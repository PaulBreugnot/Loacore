16	The bose noise cancelling is amazing , which is very important for a NYC commuter .
7	This battery is an excellent bargain !
3	Defective crap .
11	I would have given no star if I was able .
10	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them .
9	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable .
14	Unless you are in a really quiet area , you almost hear nothing .
9	I would not recommend this item to anyone .
13	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad .
8	great ... no problems at all ! .
14	As an earlier review noted , plug in this charger and nothing happens .
11	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching .
23	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not .
19	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too .
25	I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well -- it has protected my handheld perfectly so far .
7	very good product , well made .
8	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have .
17	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone .
28	I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe , everything was in good working order and overall , I am very excited to have this source .
7	The phone is sturdy and waterproof .
16	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone .
22	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5 ( of 5 )
15	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price !
16	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead .
18	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great .
4	Works great ! .
3	REALLY UGLY .
8	horrible , had to switch 3 times .
6	The noise shield is incrediable .
4	No real improvement .
6	Razr Battery - Good buy .
8	Keep up the good work Amazon ! !
7	They refuse to refund or replace .
24	Unfortunately it 's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening .
12	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing .
5	Great case and price !
19	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked .
10	I am not impressed and I am not laughing .
29	Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk , got a call , and carried the conversation without a hitch .
15	Small , sleek , impressive looking , practical setup with ample storage in place .
19	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity .
11	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly .
7	I am glad I purchased it .
10	I have missed numerous calls because of this reason .
17	Perhaps my phone is defective , but people can not hear me when I use this .
6	Do not buy this product .
13	sucked , most of the stuff does not work with my phone .
16	No shifting , no bubbling , no peeling , not even a scratch , NOTHING !
14	I could not be more happier with my new one for the Droid .
15	Worst software ever used .... If I could give this zero stars I would .
13	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration .
17	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever .
25	I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it , but the sound quality , especially outgoing , on this is better .
12	I love the camera , it 's really pretty good quality .
7	Thank you for such great service .
5	Its a total package .
16	The seller is very understanding and patient , I would definitely buy from them again .
6	I give Wirefly 1 star .
16	I will contact Cingular / AT & T ; and inform them of this practice .
4	It 's AGGRAVATING !
7	Great product for the price ! .
19	I have purchased these for both family and friends , and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
11	Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone !
11	None of it works , just do not buy it .
22	Muddy , low quality sound , and the casing around the wire 's insert was poorly super glued and slid off .
6	Please dont waste your money .
12	All in all , I am quite satisfied with this purchase .
18	If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking , this is not it .
11	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design .
3	Disapointing Results .
3	Cumbersome design .
24	Great it was new packaged nice works good , no problems and it came in less time then I expected ! ! ! !
3	Great Product .
7	It 's A PIECE OF CRAP !
30	My experience was terrible ..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset , and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra ( which I HATED ! ! !
6	This fixes all the problems .
3	Worst ever .
4	I am very happy
18	I have had no trouble accessing the Internet , downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions .
15	I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying " what ? "
7	The battery life is highly unacceptable .
6	That company is a joke .
9	It does everything the description said it would .
16	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset .
22	It works great with a car charger , especially if you can not plug in two adapters at the same time .
31	Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures , none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set , wiping out all my data .
9	Voice Quality , Signal Strength , Dropped Calls .
31	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size ; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking , however , it 's not .
4	Better than expected .
26	It feels poorly constructed , the menus are difficult to navigate , and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them .
6	Battery is holding up well .
6	Also difficult to put on .
7	I 'd recommend avoiding this product .
17	I only used it two days , and it was not always easy to hear with .
27	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken ... I went to plug it in and it started smoking .
6	Sprint - terrible customer service .
7	Linked to my phone without effort .
5	THey are so cool !
4	Easy to use .
4	Better Than New .
13	What possesed me to get this junk , I have no idea ...
4	Piece of trash .
5	A pretty good product .
7	This is a great phone ! .
18	For the price on Amazon , it is an excellent product , which I would highly recommend .
12	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they are doing .
13	The real killer is the volume , and of course it breaking .
8	Those phones are working just fine now .
9	I am more than happy with this product .
3	Poor Construction .
4	This is infuriating .
12	Overall , I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman .
6	Sprint charges for this service .
13	It is cheap , and it feel and look just as cheap .
10	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on .
9	It does not work in Europe or Asia .
16	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent 's up-and-coming .
28	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear .
24	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price .
22	the worst phone from samsung ... crap ..... this crappy Samsung E715 . . is the worst i have ever seeen .
15	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone .
3	Poor product .
7	However I needed some better instructions .
9	You need two hands to operate the screen .
15	This software interface is decade old and can not compete with new software designs .
24	Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC ( using a USB Bluetooth transceiver ) .
20	Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens , which come in a three-pack .
7	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
13	This is a great product ..... sure beats using your fingers ! .
15	Plus , I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point .
26	All the other cases I have tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul .
4	Very Dissapointing Performance .
17	Do not make the same mistake that I did and please do not buy this phone .
15	This phone might well be the worst I have ever had in any brand .
21	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear .
15	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family .
9	Do not bother - go to the store .
25	I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone , but i have the Fire Red and it 's a great color !
17	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed .
9	You get what you pay for I guess .
28	Not only did the software do a great job of this , I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection .
18	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there is not much reviews about it .
4	These are fabulous !
23	However , BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up .
21	I used bitpim ( a free program you can find on the internet ) to transfer data to the phone .
8	The price of the cable was excellent .
7	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer .
21	Performed awful -- muffled , tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call .
3	Very wind-resistant .
16	Obviously they have a terrible customer service , so you get what you pay for .
14	They do not last forever , but is not overly expensive to replace .
15	Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried .
31	I contacted the company and they told me that , although the unit was still under warranty , if I could not produce my receipt I was out of luck .
17	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something !
10	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are .
3	Great phone .
28	When I placed my treo into the case , not only was it NOT snug , but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides .
4	I am pleased .
4	Battery is terrible .
13	I found the product to be easy to set up and use .
19	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy ... it keeps falling out of my ear .
4	Utter crap . .
5	Sound quality is TERRIBLE .
14	The charger arrived within the promised timeframe , but it did not work .
14	No ear loop needed , it 's tiny and the sound is great .
25	Finally , after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor .
22	The handsfree part works fine , but then the car tries to download the address book , and the Treo reboots .
9	Overall , I still rate this device high .
6	Talk about USELESS customer service .
10	It felt too light and " tinny . " .
21	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in .
13	I am happy about this purchase - good quality and low price .
10	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones .
14	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color .
7	Does everything it should and more .
7	I could not recommend these more .
3	Nice Sound .
15	Looks good in the picture , but this case was a huge disappointment ! !
13	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with .
5	Setup went very smoothly .
12	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it .
16	A must study for anyone interested in the " worst sins " of industrial design .
12	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off .
19	It is well made , easy to access the phone and has a handy , detachable belt clip .
14	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping .
9	Can not upload ringtones from a third party .
26	Bluetooth does not work , phone locks up , screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked .
3	Truly awful .
19	It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone , and a lot better than the worn-out battery did .
16	The volume for the ringer is REAL good ( you have choices how loud ) .
8	And none of the tones is acceptable .
6	camera color balance is AWFUL .
33	This product is clearly not ready for prime time , I do not care how cool it looks , if you can not tell a call is coming in it 's worthless .
10	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat !
5	Chinese Forgeries Abound ! .
8	Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell .
13	The instructions did not explain that a microphone jack could be used .
14	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well .
17	Too bad you have to pay up to $ $ $ a month for the service !
3	Works well .
12	The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone .
4	Clear crisp sound .
16	I have to use the smallest earpieces provided , but it stays on pretty well .
12	The biggest complaint I have is , the battery drains superfast .
18	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear .
11	Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster .
12	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips .
8	It does not make you look cool .
13	Because both ears are occupied , background is not distracting at all .
26	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time , if not for an entire day .
21	Also , the phone does not seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s , preferably ripped by Windows Media Player .
9	You can not beat the price on these .
25	* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots , and even flash SOS signals ( seriously !
5	lightweight and works well .
4	So just beware .
17	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC .
11	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation .
19	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up .
16	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since .
15	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i .
10	Can not store anything but phone numbers to SIM .
16	It lasts less than 3o minutes , if I actually try to use the phone .
11	My wife has the same phone with the same problem .
3	Poor quality .
10	jabra ear gels " R " the best ! .
4	Not worth it .
13	The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced .
30	It quit working after I 'd used it for about 18 months , so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I have ever owned .
28	Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s , despite connecting it from multiple power sources ( iMac , external battery , wall outlet , etc ) .
6	It was a great phone .
20	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre .
16	Good value , works fine - power via USB , car , or wall outlet .
22	My phone does not slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand .
11	This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality !
11	Think it over when you plan to own this one !
10	This sure is the last MOTO phone for me !
25	In the span of an hour , I had two people exclaim " Whoa - is that the new phone on TV ? ! ?
16	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful .
22	This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear , it is 100 % functional .
28	Other than that , the leather is nice and soft ; the fit is very tight ; the cut out for the face is a good shape .
13	It has everything I need and I could not ask for more .
13	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke .
24	This product is great ... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something .
16	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears .
8	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere .
11	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold .
14	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months . .
1	Pros
9	Provides good protection and looks classy , too .
4	Krussel Always good .
13	The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate , etc .
6	The design is very good.4 .
7	I great reception all the time .
7	I would highly recommend this product .
13	Could not use the unit with sunglasses , not good in Texas !
13	It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320 .
12	Bought mainly for the charger , which broke soon after purchasing .
19	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations , then this phone is for you !
12	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
9	stay away from this store , be careful .
9	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME .
4	Does not fit .
23	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs .
23	It is light , has plenty of battery capacity , and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time .
2	disappointing .
7	Blue Ant is easy to use .
7	Cheap but hey it works . .
11	Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item .
24	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors ... I 'd rather be using a disposable then this .
19	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use .
21	It 's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother .
5	The nano stated it .
5	My son was dissapointed .
8	The sound quality is excellent as well .
8	Its the best headset I have used .
4	Would not reccommend .
22	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date .
5	Just what I wanted .
12	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone .
8	wont work right or atleast for me .
18	in addition it feels & amp ; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic .
15	But now that it is " out of warranty " the same problems reoccure .
15	Bottom line ... put your money somewhere else ... Cingular will not support it .
21	I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one , but it has too many issues for me .
2	The good
3	Great product .
4	Crisp and Clear .
11	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes .
11	VERY cheap plastic , creaks like an old wooden floor .
20	I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment , where with other phones I have not had this problem .
7	The reception has been generally good .
11	Excellent sound , battery life and inconspicuous to boot ! .
4	Great bluetooth ! .
6	I highly recommend this case .
2	WORTHWHILE .
6	This is a great deal .
23	After my phone got to be about a year old , it 's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part .
8	I am sorry I made this purchase .
21	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear .
22	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount .
5	It was horrible ! .
14	I do not think it would hold it too securly on your belt .
17	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first .
8	They work about 2 weeks then break .
10	It is simple to use and I like it .
14	It 's a great tool for entertainment , communication , and data management .
14	Oh , be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results !
12	I can not use this case because the smell is disgusting .
5	NOT WHAT I WANTED .
11	I own 2 of these cases and would order another .
3	Great Phone .
18	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I am very happy with my purchase .
14	The internet access was fine , it the rare instance that it worked .
5	Perfect for the PS3 .
6	Five star Plus , plus .
6	A good quality bargain . .
25	I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end could not hear me .
5	$50 Down the drain .
22	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it was not great .
5	Good , works fine .
9	For the price this was a great deal .
5	Great price , too !
11	If there is a wind , it is completely useless .
13	Yes it 's shiny on front side - and I love it !
4	Does Not Work .
25	At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44 , until I plugged it into my phone ( V3c Razr ) .
8	The reception through this headset is excellent .
6	2 thumbs up to this seller
24	I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together , good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight .
9	Improper description .... I had to return it .
9	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable .
6	Battery charge-life is quite long .
9	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well .
5	Battery has no life .
15	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing .
6	Product is exactly as described .
10	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones will not .
6	Does not do the job .
5	I would recommend it .
9	Plan on ordering from them again and again .
28	That being said , for a phone , the camera is very nice ; many cool effects to play with , and video is decent as well .
13	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one .
21	They keep getting better and better ( this is my third one and I have had numerous Palms too ) .
6	Awkward to use and unreliable .
8	The shipping time was also very quick !
8	Not as good as I had hoped .
4	Good case ! .
4	Does not Work .
4	Really good product .
6	Unfortunately it did not work .
9	All three broke within two months of use .
4	dont buy it .
12	My father has the V265 , and the battery is dying .
17	However , the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one .
27	The calls drop , the phone comes on and off at will , the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently .
5	Horrible , horrible protector .
8	I do not like this Nokia either .
23	Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable , and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3 .
17	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare .
18	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon .
14	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE ! ! ! !
3	Terrible . .
8	My car will not accept this cassette .
25	Product is useless , since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with .
9	It 's not what it says it is .
7	Stay Away From the Q ! .
4	Used and dirty .
6	Very unreliable service from T-mobile !
7	Not good enough for the price .
10	I bought two of them and neither will charge .
5	It looks very nice .
15	This is an excellent tool , especially when paired with your phone 's auto-answer .
17	I have read other 's reviews here but I have not had any problem with it .
13	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet .
5	Comfortable in my hand .
5	Just does not work .
3	Poor Reliability .
5	( It works ! )
22	If I take a picture , the battery drops a bar , and starts beeping , letting me know its dieing .
8	Terrible product , and waste of money !
6	Last time buying from you .
8	It was a waste of my money .
9	So far it has worked like a charm .
17	I have only had it for a few weeks , but so far , so good .
33	But , in any case , the best part is , you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR , or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone .
5	Would recommend this item .
9	It 's been my choice headset for years .
10	Great sound ; good volume ; good noise cancellation .
9	Nice case , feels good in your hands .
6	The item received was Counterfeit .
5	Just really good . .
13	So far , probably the best BT headset I have ever had .
3	Works fine .
13	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it .
20	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip .
10	My sister has one also and she loves it .
3	Good Quality .
13	This is by far the worst purchase I have made on Amazon .
4	Excellent dual-purpose headset .
3	Excellent ! .
12	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 .
18	It seems completely secure , both holding on to my belt , and keeping the iPhone inside .
12	The bottowm line ... another worthless , cheap gimmick from Sprint .
5	Having trouble with volume .
13	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears .
8	WARNING - DO NOT BUY ! ! .
19	I am pairing this with my iphone , and I could not be happier with it so far .
16	When it opens , the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off .
17	I did not want the clip going over the top of my ear , causing discomfort .
7	Best headset ever ! ! ! .
13	Do not trust their website and do not expect any helpful support .
5	It was that loud .
22	Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use .
16	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap .
11	Fits comfortably , came with three sizes of earbud tips .
6	Excellent product for the price .
3	Bad Reception .
14	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP ! ! ! ! ! !
8	It was quite comfortable in the ear .
3	Great phone .
10	Do not buy this product - It fails ! .
7	Everything about this product is wrong .
1	First
26	The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature .
21	This was utterly confusing at first , which caused me to lose a couple of very , very important contacts .
4	Terrible phone holder .
8	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly .
15	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell .
15	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily .
13	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look .
25	But despite these few flaws , this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product .
5	How stupid is that ?
26	I can hear while I am driving in the car , and usually do not even have to put it on it 's loudest setting .
10	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors .
5	Good show , Samsung .
13	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money .
16	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed .
5	Could not figure it out
32	My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK ) , but my wife 's phone was almost totally unintelligible , she could not understand a word being said on it .
21	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it .
27	While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place , the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop .
7	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild ! .
4	Works for me .
