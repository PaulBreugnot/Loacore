26	This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004 , so I was definitely going to watch the repeat .
36	I really sympathised with the main character of the film , because , this is true , I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had , Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) .
20	This is a sad , sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder .
26	Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid ( because of wasting vocal muscle ) and never went through puberty , but he is 36 years old .
15	Most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition , and pealing off his bandages .
24	Jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour , he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin .
29	He tells his story with the help of his mother , Edna Kennedy , his older brother and celebrity model , and Jonny 's supporter , Nell McAndrew .
31	It won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director ( Factual ) , and it was nominated for Best Sound ( Factual ) and the Flaherty Documentary Award .
12	It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004 .
5	A must see documentary !
15	This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time .
12	Jonny Kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration .
43	Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there , but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love .
10	Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching .
14	Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming .
7	And seeing him smile was indescribable .
15	I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant .
22	Please , if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy .
8	This man is nothing short of amazing .
27	You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events , and cry along with his family in the end .
31	He was so passionate about his cause , not just for himself , but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain .
44	I watch this video every time I am having a bad or " down " day , and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life , just like Jonny did , even with his unbearable pain .
32	My only regret is not knowing about Jonny sooner , as I visited England 2 times during his life , and would have been able to say I 'd met him .
15	It is comforting to know Jonny is sitting on his cloud , pain free !
7	Rest in peace , Dear Jonny .
4	You deserve it !
11	The most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created .
12	I cried the whole way through , from start to end .
27	Watching the show you are immediately captured by a man 's struggle to live without pain , to live a life we would take for granted .
36	The first time I heard the title , I was almost scared to see the program , it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life .
6	I truly felt for him .
14	The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny picks out his coffin .
6	Could you imagine doing that ?
8	In September 2003 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died .
44	He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch , leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer .
46	In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death , and the result was a film , first broadcast in March , that was an uplifting , confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man .
24	Not shying away from the grim reality of EB , the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full .
29	Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary of that year .
25	It attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to Jonny 's charity , DEBRA .
30	A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that Jonny Kennedy left a one million pound legacy .
17	I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy .
21	I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard anybody say a bad word about him .
24	I hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition .
16	This man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not .
11	I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools .
15	I also agree with other comments - what have I got to moan about ?
19	He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour .
3	God Bless .
13	I could not watch the part that showed his dressings being changed .
9	I have enough trouble with my son 's .
48	Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions , so I turned to my twin sister and said , " Hey this looks like fun , " - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it .
36	At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man , but then it was explained that due to his condition , he never went through puberty , thus the high voice and smaller body .
12	He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause .
37	He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried , watched some more , laughed , got up to get another Kleenex , then cried some more .
19	Once Jonni Kennedy 's " time was up " he flew to heaven to be with the angels .
19	He was more than ready ; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free .
5	I highly recommend this .
16	If you do not fall in love with this guy , you have no heart .
14	I could not hold back the tears when I watched this beautiful documentary .
12	It was heart-breaking , disturbing , and inspiring all in one .
23	I recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives .
10	Or simply , something that will make you think .
14	You watch as John lives through the last couple months of his life .
13	You watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude .
15	At one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual .
14	You begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us .
32	His life and struggles will make you cry , laugh , and find that life 's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time .
16	One of Cary Grant 's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House .
16	Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today .
37	Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham .
18	What made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post World War II years .
20	Returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the GI Bill of Rights which included home loans .
14	The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand .
40	Around the time the book by Eric Hodgins and the film were so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender - Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business .
25	I had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early Fifties .
21	Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester .
34	Their place was not quite as grand as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms , still they lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna most likely did .
23	Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up , threatening to send Cary to the cleaners .
16	Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer counsel , usually too late .
15	Truth be told he 's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it .
12	Myrna Loy 's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles .
29	If you can imagine the Charles 's moving to the country and William Powell having the headaches Cary Grant does , the film would still work just fine .
17	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal .
24	And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years .
44	As with all of Angelopoulos ' films , " The Suspended Step of the Stork " implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer , a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work .
21	Dialogues are sparing , with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters ' inner conflicts , doubts , or feelings .
29	The filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses , and instead forces them to explore and study the characters ' identities for themselves .
18	As a result , the acting is understated and implicit , as opposed to overt and explicit .
35	The action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation , where the viewer is asked to become a participant , to participate as an actor , by probing his or her own psyche .
37	Angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity , reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures , gazes , sounds , and music , when he believes that words can only take us so far .
31	The music , by Angelopoulos ' long time collaborator , Eleni Karaindrou , provides more than just a discreet background , but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story .
23	A large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle , subdued colors , recorded in a drab winter light .
35	Angelopoulos presents us with an " other Greece , " one far different from the Greece of the tourist brochures , with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas , drowned in an eternal sunshine .
37	Here , the skies are covered and gray , the air is cold and misty , and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled , dirty snow of the village streets .
45	Angelopoulos ' genius through Arvanitis ' camera is on display throughout the film . " The Suspended Step of the Stork " is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the Balkans at the end of the twentieth century .
25	It is deeply concerned with the meaning of " borders , " and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations .
27	In the " waiting room " facing the Albanian border , the refugees , political or other , outcast by the rest of humanity , wait .
39	They may be stuck against a political border , but unfortunately they still carry with them , and hang on , deeper ancestral borders : those of the languages , of the customs , and of the races .
26	Although Angelopoulos ' political views are well known , the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees ' plights .
49	In the process , Angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical , cultural , political , and personal " borders . " Angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century Greece , and he likes to bring lessons from the Hellenic myths into his discussions .
30	In this film , he does some border crossing himself between the Greek and Italian cultures , drawing from a combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition of Odysseus ' travel .
27	Alexander is a Telemachus , in search of a story about an aging Greek politician / Odysseus who disappeared , never to be heard of again .
41	This political man , a brilliant orator , unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence , his wife , and his brilliant career , to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low .
13	He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world .
28	Of course , the " politician " is not Alexander 's father , but the " politician " stands before Alexander like a father figure / Odysseus .
15	As with Homer 's Telemachus , Alexander grows as a person during his odyssey .
25	Of course , it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of Homer 's Odyssey in a contemporary context .
16	Angelopoulos draws on Odysseus 's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film .
36	They appear like " stylites , " religious figures found in the Orthodox tradition , solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars , in a form of asceticism .
18	The film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by Mastroianni .
30	Angelopoulos does not give us any clues , and the wife 's statement , " It 's not him , " is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough .
26	The important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician , but that he could be the politician .
10	But the film still ends on an optimistic note .
19	On this account , Angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow , some of the borders will eventually crumble .
48	A most recommendable masterpiece , not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of Angelopoulos , not to mention the acting of giants , Mastroianni and Moreau , and the remarkable character play by Ilias Logothethis .
19	It 's an " art movie " in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention .
25	Not for spending free time , but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert .
13	Due to the overall photographic style , large screen viewing is recommended .
5	Dialogues are used sparingly .
41	But the film includes - in addition to the standard Greek and English speaking - fragments spoken in Albanian , Kurdish and Turkish , which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages .
19	This is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art , not an entertainment business .
13	Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany utterly captivating .
17	You get absorbed into the dream and you are let go only at the end credits .
19	The plot necessarily comes second , but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised .
3	Just wonderful .
5	I loved this film .
32	I first saw it when I was 20 ( which was only four years ago ) and I enjoyed it so much , I brought my own copy the next day .
9	The comedy is well played by all involved .
30	I always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area .
11	Also look for Jason Robards father who plays Mr. Retch .
6	Talent ran in that family .
37	Enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially , William Powell , ( Dr. Lawrence Bradford ) , " Mister Roberts " , who played the role as a doctor and detective .
38	Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur , ( Paula Bradford ) , " Shane " , and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time .
21	Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important .
36	Jean Arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 Comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe , especially with a jockey on a California Race Track .
43	Robert Armstrong , ( Nick Martel ) " King Kong " gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with James Gleason , a detective who need the help of Dr. Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery .
37	If you see this film , just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in Those DAYS !
32	William Powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in " The Ex-Mrs . Bradford , " also starring Jean Arthur , Eric Blore , and James Gleason .
18	It seems that Powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed .
41	Though he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen couple , the actor made a couple of other " Thin Man " type movies , one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur , both to very good effect .
25	Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty , debonair professional and " The Ex-Mrs . Bradford " is no exception .
3	The ex-Mrs .
29	B has Mr. B served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she 's dragged him into .
12	And this is not the first time she 's done that !
44	It almost seems as though there was a " Bradford " film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases .
25	This time , a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line .
16	The solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it 's beside the point .
15	The point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-Mrs .
13	B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny .
22	However , with an actress who comes off as brainy as Arthur does , the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained .
19	I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say , the wacky side of Carole Lombard .
19	It still works well , and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own .
13	Definitely worth watching , as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were .
31	I have seen the Thin Man series -- Powell and Loy are definitely great , but there is something awfully sweet about Powell and Arthur 's chemistry in this flick .
9	Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell .
9	There is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them .
22	This film may not have the wit of the Thin Man series , but undeniably makes up for it in charm .
19	While I watched it , I thought for sure Powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with Arthur .
6	My friends thought the same .
35	This is one film where I wish I could step back in time ( to schmooze and lock lips with Powell ! ) There seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks !
35	Powell 's character , Lawrence Bradford , is probably the closest thing to the " perfect man . " Okay , this is sounding way too gushy , but I can not help myself .
35	RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia , for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of The Thin Man .
6	They succeeded to some degree .
30	A lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles , Bill Powell also played in a few Philo Vance films in the title role .
13	So by this time he was pretty well set in the role .
22	Doctor Bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles , but the basic blasé Nick is still there .
21	One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress , Doctor Bradford works for a living as a physician .
16	That helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film .
8	He 's got two murders to solve .
21	A jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason .
20	The trainer suspects something afoot , but he 's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet .
11	This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help .
15	Myrna Loy was a more steadying influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was .
13	Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than Loy did .
12	But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry .
18	The ever dependable James Gleason is the police inspector in the Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton role .
19	All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore as Powell 's butler was essaying that part .
20	If Powell and Arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of Bradford films .
29	The comic banter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery , which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever .
29	Powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30 's , and Arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells .
26	They are extremely fun to watch , so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold .
12	Eric Blore also has some comic turns as Powell 's butler .
41	Powell 's contract with MGM included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio , but he wanted to work again with Arthur and he liked the script , so he eagerly accepted the assignment .
27	They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films , The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case , both in the Philo Vance series .
28	I have just managed to get hold of the Celestial region 3 DVD of The Five Venoms and what a super job they have made of it .
15	A fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any Kung Fu fan .
21	The story is pretty straight forward , and has been mentioned already so I will not go into it again .
21	Needless to say it 's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for , and they do not disappoint .
16	Only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed .
18	Bruce Lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time !
29	All kicks and punches come with the all important " type writer " clicks and air " whooshes " , which is a cool effect though quite amusing !
7	I give this movie a B+ .
5	Good but not great .
13	In a way I feel it could have been that bit better .
20	Golden Swallow , by the same director a decade earlier , had as good a story and better action .
25	The Five Deadly Venoms is easily the most memorable K.F. flick from the Shaw Brothers ' stable ( exc . maybe Master Killer ) .
37	It has the artists who came to be known as simply " The Venoms " , some of the best fight choreography ever , and , surprisingly for a Kung Fu movie , a great plot !
8	One of my all-time favorites ! ! !
33	Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas , but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in Hong Kong film history .
14	Director Chang Cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece .
14	This movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms .
8	Meng Lo plays yet another bad ass .
10	He would go on to be in Super Ninjas .
17	Kuo Chui who is Philip Kwok would go on to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled .
8	Any chop socky fan can apperciate this .
20	But I still think it ai not as good as Super Ninjas ( also made by Chang Cheh ) .
15	But all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best .
9	I recall seeing this movie as a kid .
9	I do not recall where I saw it .
9	I must have been around 14 years old .
13	I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again .
14	It came on the Kung Fu channel once , but I missed it .
5	I was really bummed .
15	It is the best special-effects Kung Fu movie that I have seen to date !
28	I highly recommend it , and now that I have discovered where to get it , I can enjoy it once more and for years to come .
20	I also have to check out this Return of the Venom movie of which some have spoken so highly .
26	By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over , as films were moving in a different direction , comedically and otherwise .
18	With television looming on the horizon , Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time .
29	Where , one wonders , would movies have gone had television not come along , or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years ?
15	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed .
16	So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications .
4	Well , almost .
16	Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind .
7	Then again he might not have .
3	You decide .
33	On this frail premise a wonderful film results , full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one 's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one .
29	Nothing comes easy in this life , as Mr. Blandings learns ; but one need not be miserable just because things do not always go one 's way .
10	There is , after all , the long run .
14	But , Blandings asks himself every few minutes , how long is long ?
6	This movie is a delight .
49	It is not , I suppose , a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition , but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures , and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically .
33	There is real warmth in the picture , and a good deal of ( W.C. ) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically , but not so much as to leave a bad taste .
26	The people in the film are all very smart and affluent , but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class .
43	Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection ; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend , who often has to bring up unpleasant topics , such as how the real world works .
17	These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut .
37	After reading tons of good reviews about this movie I decided to take it for a spin ( I bought it on DVD , hence the " spin " pun ... I am a dork ) .
34	The beginning was everything I hoped for , a perfect set-up ( along with some quotes that I have heard on Various Wu-Tang albums ) to what should have been a good movie .
13	But the plot I heard was so great , was so predictable .
19	Every time I saw a character ( except for the Lizard ) I guessed which Venom he was .
16	Plus , the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie .
19	Ok , so the plot was not very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right ?
2	Wrong .
11	The fights were very short and few and far between .
16	Granted the different styles were all pretty cool but I wish the fights were longer .
21	I kept hoping to see the Lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened .
17	I was hoping to see the Centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened .
21	I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened .
7	In short , not much happens .
7	The fighting is all pretty routine .
22	Do not be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot , it does not mean it 's a good one .
24	When I was very young , on a local tv station , they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays .
10	I saw lots of Kung Fu movies on weekends .
6	I remember lots of them .
35	I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters , Blind Fist of Bruce , Kung Fu Zombie , Shaolin Drunken Monk , Rage of the Master , Tattoe Dragon , and ... Five Deadly Venoms .
6	I remember the day clearly .
12	Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King .
14	We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday .
40	We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch , turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it .
10	Then under that was the Title of the film .
6	It said Five Deadly Venoms .
5	Then the movie began .
11	I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence .
10	I loved this movie the minute it came on .
8	My favorite character was the Toad Venom .
22	The plot was hard to follow at that age but that was not what lured me ... it was the fighting .
7	The fights were so ... amazing .
23	I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended .
6	This movie is really good .
19	The plot , which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess , what will happen next .
21	Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle .
6	Fighting scenes are very good .
35	There is a lot of different combat styles ( although one of styles was a bit unreal for me , but it 's only my opinion ) to watch and it 's fascinating show .
11	The only thing which may be irritating is actors look .
11	A bit too effeminate ( at least for me ) .
32	Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70 's and 80 's , so " Five Venoms " ( or other its versions ) is great choice .
20	I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid , and I thought it was so cool !
17	Now I am 26 years old , and my friend has it on DVD ! ! !
12	We got a case of brew , and watched this classic !
11	It lost NONE of it 's original kung fu coolness !
23	If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies , this is a must see ... the DVD is available .
13	I believe this movie is also called " Pick Your Poison " .
4	Watch it soon !
6	I really like this movie .
14	I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it .
13	I suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie .
6	The story is very interesting .
22	It introduces us to 6 characters ; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly .
20	Each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other .
29	The dying master sends the 6th venom , his last student , to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed .
10	How will the last pupil find the other venoms ?
10	How will he know which of them is bad ?
15	The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great .
14	We also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination .
14	It is fun to see how their styles match up against each other .
21	If you want to see if you like kung fu movies , this is a good movie to start with .
9	It does not get any better than this .
18	If you love kung-fu films and you have not seen this movie , you are cheating yourself .
21	This movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film .
24	Normally , it takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films , but this one has it all !
9	The story is well told , and complete .
23	The fight scenes are great , and tend to end before you are completely bored with them ( unlike Crouching Tiger ) .
18	Throw in a little mystery and torture and you have got yourself one heck of a movie .
7	See this one at all costs .
8	Heck , my wife even enjoyed it .
8	Wu Du it ! 9 out of 10
24	This is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular Shaw Brothers from the late 70 's .
24	The plot is interesting and twisty , the characters are cool each with their own style - toad , snake , lizard etc .
30	The action is limited in comparison with other Chang Cheh / Venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters .
36	I recommend this film to those who think all Shaw Brothers especially Chang Cheh 's films are the same , most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and Shaolin vs Manchu conflicts .
10	This film is breath of fresh air in comparison .
31	A dying Kung Fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned Poison Clan .
46	He is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them The master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good .
32	The earlier students were all taught in a different style snake , centipede , scorpion , lizard , toad , while the last student was taught a little in each style .
30	All of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money , and soon everyone is battling to get the money .
12	Classic martial arts film has title that even many non-fans know .
23	I have spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head .
46	Its a very good movie , though I am not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the Shaw studio ( One armed Swordmen or the Brave Archer series for example ) .
44	This is not to sell the film short , its not , since the film is structured like a mystery , our hero has no clue who anyone is and the Venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is .
20	We are given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is .
47	The film is also odd in that for a martial arts film , other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money , there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes .
6	Around 7 out of 10 .
30	One of the more enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema ( or , indeed , most anything done outside these holier-than-thou United States ) are the permutations that crop up .
33	In post-World War Two Japanese manga ( comics ) , for instance , are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects , many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion .
50	The same thing happens in genre film-making , as well ; though , again , I am referring to movies made outside the U. $ . ( where we are just too " sophisticated " in our close-mindedness to appreciate anything that is not about or by US ) .
43	Would an American company , for instance , back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler ( El Santo ) or a werewolf ( Paul Naschy ) or a real-life martial artist ( Bruce Lee ) ... ?
7	As for television : forget it .
39	While I still love the KUNG FU series that starred the late David Carradine , I have always felt that the Americanized version of Asian martial arts was - how to put it kindly - a bit lacking .
35	In its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit ( western , cop show , etc . ) , this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work .
33	It 's now available from Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and the DVD commentary by Bey Logan is EXACTLY the kind of intelligent , thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve .
50	If you are a martial arts movie fan , rejoice : one of the greatest movie genres of all time ( specifically , the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s ) are getting a long-overdue second life ( and greatly appreciated second look ) on DVD .
37	Even if you are normally not a fan of old-school movies , you need to check The Five Deadly Venoms out , if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from . "
30	There is no romance or other side plot to this movie , it 's action and intrigue all the way , making it a real man 's kung-fu movie .
33	An aging master dispatches his last disciple Yan Tieh to stop his five former pupils who 's styles represents five venomous animals centipede , snake , scorpion , lizard and the toad .
21	Despite the word " Venom " in the title , none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents .
32	Yan Tieh told by his teacher that he 's no match for the five former pupil , must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four .
26	How Yan Tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story , with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story .
22	Recognized as a cult classic , this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung - fu action movies .
19	It 's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story .
13	One movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan .
24	Of all the kung-fu films made through the 70 's and 80 's this is one that has developed a real cult following .
30	With the exception of all the films Bruce Lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story .
24	An aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil Yang Tieh ( Sheng Chiang ) about five pupils he has trained in the past .
21	All five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently .
21	Their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like Lizard , Snake , Centipede , Toad and Scorpion .
40	The master called them the Poison Clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants Tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil .
32	An old man who was once a member of the Poison Clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target .
24	Tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are .
37	Tieh has discovered that the Snake is Hung Wen Tung ( Pai Wei ) and along with Tang Sen Kue ( Feng Lu ) who is the Centipede they kill a family to find the map .
23	A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is .
25	A local policeman named Ho Yung Sin ( Philip Kwok ) investigates the murders along with his partner Ma Chow ( Chien Sun ) .
24	Sin has a friend called Li Ho ( Meng Lo ) who is the Toad and they do know of each others identity .
25	The Snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on Li Ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed .
19	When Sin finds out he teams up with Tieh and together they go to combat Tung and Kue .
21	This film was directed by Cheh Chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films .
21	Chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them .
18	While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme .
20	Even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that .
14	Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks .
16	Then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is .
24	Very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of Changs stories were in a class all by themselves .
34	I would not exactly put it in the same league as " Enter The Dragon " because Bruce Lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking .
30	This film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film is not necessarily about fight scenes .
15	Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved .
12	That alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films .
8	Very well made with a unique story .
6	Be careful with this one .
19	Once you get yer mitts on it , it will change the way you look at kung-fu flicks .
41	You will be yearning a plot from all of the kung-fu films now , you will be wanting character depth and development , you will be craving mystery and unpredictability , you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops .
22	Sadly , you will not find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie , EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms !
42	Easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time , Venoms blends a rich plot , full of twists and turns , with colourful ( and developed ) characters , along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s .
26	The success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which , and who specializes in what venom .
26	One is the Centipede , two is the Snake , three is the Scorpion , four is the Lizard , and five is the Toad .
13	Each character has different traits , characteristics , strengths , and weaknesses .
24	Therein lies the hook , we learn along with the student character , finding out who these different men turn out to be .
31	We are in his shoes ( so to speak ) , and we have to pick who we trust , and who we do not , just like he does .
6	We learn along with him .
39	Not only is the plot , the characters , and the camerawork great , it 's also fun to watch , which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it 's kind .
17	It 's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that 's going on .
27	Venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do ... just do not expect many other kung-fu films to live up to it 's gauntlet .
44	After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years , I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism , nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth .
42	The story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his " unfinished " pupil out to find the 5 past members of his Poison Clan , so they do not seek out a fortune which the master 's friend keeps hidden .
31	Afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training , he instructs him to befriend one of the five " venoms " so as to defeat the other four .
13	I can not say enough about the choreography or the camera work .
20	A fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made .
4	A CLASSIC ! !
15	Well , I must say that this was one hell of a fun movie .
34	Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy , and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason , I was not disappointed .
41	The story was actually pretty interesting : the last member of the Poison Clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil , and who is using them for good .
28	The catch being that during training , all of the clan were masked , and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names .
36	The fights are a joy to watch , as each member of the Poison Clan has a different fighting style : toad ( my favorite ) , snake , scorpion , lizard , and centipede .
34	The fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place , and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action .
26	The one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence .
12	But stick with it , and you will not be disappointed !
47	Most 70s ( and 80s ) Kong Kong martial arts films barely function as movies ; usually there are a few well-planned fight sequences , but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes -- like porno films , really .
8	But this one does several things well .
37	Most overtly , there is the direction and choreography , which confines each combatant to a ' style ' -- it 's really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater , but the effect works .
13	Least overt , but most powerful and unexpected , is the construction .
15	The winner of this contest is determined by who ' unfolds ' the story .
33	The master ( the writer ) sets up a game where the lead character does not know who he 's seeking , which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in .
22	One by one , he figures out who is who , at the same rate we find out who is who .
9	It all follows a tragedy / noir arc .
13	The ending tends toward irony , a la " The Sting " .
14	Much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre .
25	The ' five venoms ' idea is the template for Tarantino 's ' deadly viper assassins ' from the " Kill Bill " volumes .
31	For all the hoopla , respect and recognition this film gets from Kung Fu historians , it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas : action and fight scenes .
24	But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I have ever seen in a martial arts film .
42	Five Deadly Venoms without a doubt is a must see , not only that , a movie you can watch again and again ; but I also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better .
11	It somehow leaves you wanting something , you want more .
28	The producer Chang Cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but does not follow through with giving us more of the action we want .
32	The fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer ( Centipede , Snake , Scorpion , Lizard , Toad ) and they are shown , but battles are noticeably short .
32	The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much , much more , in fact the Toad is killed off by the middle of the movie .
44	Interestingly enough with this movie , the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot , this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome .
18	This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe .
17	Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel .
21	To start off the movie and to introduce the Poison Clan producer Chang Cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon .
16	The ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more .
15	Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable .
50	My overall impression of the movie would conclude with this : The styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail , sad thing is , the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and did not expand on it .
27	I am left wondering what could have been with this movie , still one of the best though . 8 out of 10 on the scale .
18	Seldom do I ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that I must speak about it immediately .
16	This movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic .
25	I happened to see the dubbed version but I am on my way right now to grab the DVD remaster with original Chinese dialogue .
44	Still , the dubbing did not get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour : " Poison Clan rocks the world ! ! ! " The story-telling stays true to Chinese methods of intrigue , suspense , and inter-personal relationships .
20	You can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace .
20	The martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed .
20	It 's like watching real animals fight each other , but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms .
14	Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema .
12	I always enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV .
16	The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery .
38	There are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick : great choreography , awful dubbing , different " styles " of fighting , and a wide range of greatly exaggerated , often cheesey human emotions .
9	However the plot certainly is better than average .
12	It 's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes .
20	Occasionally it 's even able to fire up the audience , such as when X character receives horrible injustice .
21	Another thing I love about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie 's morals and themes .
10	Just about everyone gets what 's coming to them .
10	The cowardly , greedy , and corrupt lose out .
18	The bad guys , consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing .
20	The good guys use teamwork , planning , and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top .
4	Poison Clan rocks !
41	This is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever , and may be one of the best movies ever ... It 's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle , with lots of intrigue and suspense .
21	This film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions , with people hiding their identities and their natures .
18	The characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters .
25	They are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality 's and desires .
18	The fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting .
20	It has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy .
24	There are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal .
45	The styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film ... When this happens , The director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel .
18	These cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely .
16	One thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death .
15	The director Chang Cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death .
13	This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective .
11	We actually care when people are killed in this film .
19	This is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed .
12	Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching .
15	When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain .
12	At the same time , this is also a fun movie .
15	It has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film .
18	There is bad dubbing , The characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat .
30	Some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic ... all this just adds to the greatness of the film .
20	And lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries .
18	If you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic .
34	Everything goes by so fast ( because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre ) that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is .
9	The lighting and composition are spectacular at times .
36	The camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing ... In the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example , imagine Hitchcock moving at about twice the speed .
27	Chang Cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it 's confines .
37	He does not rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film , but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work .
12	He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people .
15	This is the real package A kung fu movie that delivers on every level .
42	It 's art , it 's trash , it 's emotionally moving , and it 's fun , it has a true sense of morality , but does not allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action .
16	I recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not .
14	The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first .
18	The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off .
18	However , I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this Comedy Central gem .
34	I could possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah 's character is a true sociopath , very comparable to Sedaris ' Jerri Blank .
11	The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast .
21	Her sister 's character is good ; Funny at times , but ultimately meant not to steal Sarah 's show .
13	However , the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison .
26	I am glad , though , that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor .
19	I would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes .
10	You people are so damn sensitive it is inane !
14	Abortion jokes are great because , really , who takes abortion seriously anyways ?
11	At least I am not a * bore * son .
23	I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together .
8	Talk about a movie of the year !
40	I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review , takes pity on me , whisks me to Hollywood and involves me in her freaky / funny world .
9	But in all seriousness , it was good .
23	First episode is obviously finding it 's feet , but it 's got that Silverman weirdness running all the way through it .
23	I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with it 's weird characters and incredibly strong central character .
12	Well worth a watch , look forward to the following episodes .
15	A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there . ps , Sarah ?
3	Call me ....
12	The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than those other shows .
12	No laugh tracks , no painful jokes , just a program .
5	The Sarah Silverman program .
19	If you are like me , and you love comedy , this is probably a show for you .
13	Sarah Silverman brings out-there-funny , and right-here-funny to the table with ease .
12	A mix of different styles , which makes for its own .
30	This program is not something you want to start a compare war with , seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them ( other shows ) .
19	This show is its own entity , and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine .
5	Go watch and see .
5	Best show since Seinfeld .
6	She 's really really funny .
26	Her total self centeredness , the hulking gay stoner neighbors , the departures into song or cartoons , make this the freshest show on TV .
11	One of the few shows I make point of watching .
18	The shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they are too darn normal ! !
23	I really can not wait until the next show , something I have not felt for any show in a long time .
44	If Silverman tones down the juvenile " doody " jokes and emphasizes the darker , meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at , we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled " Strangers With Candy " .
24	But just from watching the pilot , its just solid , not outstanding , offbeat dark comedy / musical but with huge potential .
48	Silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier , younger , Jewish American Princess version of the late great Jerri Blank and the show features one of the most unconventional , non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have ever seen on television .
24	Early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so I can not wait to see how this show unfolds .
32	The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah 's own stand up ; It 's so over the top with prejudice that you can not possibly take it to heart .
27	The fact is , though , that while most all people will " get it , " it does not mean they will all appreciate it .
29	It 's a very polarizing and one dimensional show , so if you do not like it after 10 minutes , you may as well give up there .
25	If you do like it after 10 minutes , stay tuned , because every episode thus far has been as good as the last .
11	Like all shows , though , it is not perfect .
15	Personally I love the program , but there are some huge faults with it .
31	Racist songs are funny , but get older a lot faster than Silverman seems to realize -- a problem that I had with " Jesus is Magic " as well .
20	It seems as if Silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that does not need to exist .
23	Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good , the music , well , is not .
36	Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of Monty Python , Upright Citizens Brigade , etc . , it is nothing like those shows .
32	I can watch Monty Python all day , but , as much as I like this show , I can not watch more than the half hour limit at a time .
6	It gets flat very fast .
34	The repeat value for this show is low too -- the second time around an episode is fairly funny , and by the third time , in my opinion , it 's boring .
12	Still , that first time around is very , very funny .
5	Give it a shot .
37	Following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use .
27	Sarah 's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed .
13	Every time she speaks it 's like a self-contained 5 second skit .
40	She overemotes a lot , demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify , but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied .
14	This may be the most creative , original and experimental TV program ever .
33	First and foremost I would like to say that I am a huge Sarah Silverman fan , and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me .
26	Everything in the pilot was in typical Sarah Silverman form , maybe not directly funny , but the situation and the delivery are what counts .
18	If you liked Jesus is Magic then I do not see how you would not like this .
10	It has that same flow and that same rhythm .
18	True it 's only for the true fans , but if you are you will be pleased .
14	Again only for the true fans , there is no way around that .
18	If you are not used to her style then you would not get why this is funny .
13	However , it is , and I hope you think so too .
19	This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud .
19	In other places , I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious , politically correct prigs .
24	There is neither here , unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid .
14	The lines are hilarious , and all the leads have never been better .
6	Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant .
45	If you have ever thought of or tried to build a new house , you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process , no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel , you are not alone !
13	When I first saw this show , I thought it looked interesting .
22	I watched it , saw how it revolved around Sarah , like the character sees the world ... revolving around her .
11	I got it , but was not laughing very much .
17	Onstage and in her show , she 's racist , crude , insensitive and hugely self-centered .
16	I did not get her at first , and took it all at face value .
12	Then I got to see her movie , Jesus is Magic .
24	I think that served as a Sarah Silverman primer for me , explaining to me just what ' language ' she 's speaking .
35	She 's like Marilyn Manson , working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images , but you eventually realise it is not an assault , it 's a statement .
20	And once you understand that , you find you are glad someone 's finally giving it to you straight .
24	I do not mean to suggest only smart people will understand , or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy .
26	While I like a lot of ' smart ' shows , I still to this day do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm .
17	I get the impression that it 's good , but I just do not get it .
19	Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program , but I am glad I eventually came around .
31	The creators of this show do work hard , every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot , but with songs , or dream sequences , production numbers .
33	These people are not putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers , they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together .
27	If I was to predict the future of this show , I 'd say it will go the way of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks .
19	It will get canceled before it 's time and live on in fans ' hearts and on DVD .
29	But take heart , SSP creators , your audience IS out there , and we will be watching for as long as they let you make the show .
25	Big S is not playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like , say Mencia or Chapelle ( though I like them both ) .
11	She states the obvious in subtle , near subliminal remarks .
14	Her show will not change the World , nor is it meant to .
33	But , along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster 's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of " Mr. Show " fame , this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction !
11	My side 's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode .
28	Look , I love this woman and like her famed boyfriend , Jimmy Kimmel , she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run - with-it .
7	The best kind of comedy around .
34	Spoofing anything and anyone , like " Mary Poppins " in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense .
33	This one is highly recommended , but only for those who still have a funny bone ( and did not lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job ) .
7	Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch !
14	She 's beautiful , sexy , funny and talent , dark and demonic .
25	I read the other ' comment ' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just do not get it .
9	Nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident .
22	Too much money , time and work is put into the production of a T.V. show for there to be mistakes .
12	This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid .
12	This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile .
21	I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre .
23	It 's a lot like Pee-Wee's Playhouse for maladjusted , slacker twenty-something glue sniffing , Future Pornstars of America from the Valley .
5	The cast is awesome .
7	The scenarios and action is well-paced .
17	I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central did not let David spade keep his show .
6	Who plays Sarah 's sister ?
13	She not in the cast listing on the show 's home page .
8	I would love to see her stand-up .
18	Does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or DVDs that may be floating around out there ?
8	I think this show is screamingly funny !
24	It 's not for every taste , and I am not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that do not get it .
15	I am sure they are wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength .
11	But if you like it , you REALLY like it .
32	Sarah plays a self-infatuated loser named " Sarah Silverman " who often finds her self in Homerian predicaments ( that 's " Homerian " as in " Homerian Simpsonian " ) .
18	I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief gig on Saturday Night Live in the early 90 's .
20	I liked her immediately then and I go out of my way to check out anything she 's done .
6	This show is choke-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants funny .
12	Therefore I always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers .
4	Check it out !
18	Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I am in love already .
14	Yeah , if you loved Jesus is Magic , you will love this .
13	If you did not , what the heck is wrong with you ?
12	Kudos to the Comedy Channel for shoving this in my face .
20	My life finally has meaning , and " Your car smells like farts " is my kind of humor .
6	I am a happy guy .
17	The first episode had me laughing hysterically and I am hungrily looking forward to next week .
8	This is like Grease meets South Park .
3	Completely outrageous .
12	Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book .
9	Her delivery is precise and oh so funny .
6	She never skips a beat .
37	Come to think of it , it 's not so much her choice of material . which is some really good stuff by the way , as it is the way she chooses to deliver it .
6	Thank you , Sarah Silverman !
6	Thank you , Comedy Channel !
33	I originally scored Sarah 's show with a nice fat 8 , but I have struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what 's settled in .
4	I shall explain .
13	You will either like Sarah 's humor , or you will not .
12	If you do not , I doubt anyone could persuade you .
19	You folks know who you are and it 's perfectly fine , but then you know that too .
24	Moving on , the first season gave us fantastic bits about Sarah , her friends and family , and her pursuits in life .
17	It seemed to be a genuine question . - That is funny stuff in my book .
9	Sarah can come at you from odd angles .
12	In another episode , her affair with God was notably funny .
11	God being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke .
24	It is clever , it is a twisted view , but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed .
7	Then , came the second season .
26	While still not without some new and inventive comedy , we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes , quite simply .
30	I get some good laughs here and there , but much of it seems like filler while she , and the writers , struggle to foment some original material .
39	Sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings I have for the episodes lately , but I have been gutting it out for the gems I do find ( the turtle ) and waiting for her to turn it around .
26	I was a fan of her " Jesus is Magic " routine and would like to think that I understand what she is capable of .
7	Let us get back to that .
20	For those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity , you are in fact the mindless one .
34	While the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems , racial barriers , cliché 's , stereotypes etc .
17	You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it .
12	What I also love is that not everything is a punchline .
22	For those expecting a formulated joke like Friends ( I LOVE friends fyi ) , you will not find it here .
16	Instead Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic .
22	We do not walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said , which is in most comedies .
13	Instead the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this sense .
17	So do not take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that .
9	This show probably will not appeal to everyone .
18	Sarah does what she wants ; she does not ask for permission and she does not apologize .
21	This is a sitcom with zombies , robot dinosaurs , flying cars , and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders .
18	The star of the show is not a hero , she is a spoiled , bigoted pervert .
19	If you can not appreciate the offbeat humor it offers , the show probably is not for you .
10	Everyone should at least give this show a chance .
10	This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment .
32	This show is so incredibly hilarious that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight ( despite the fact that I have seen all the episodes previously ) .
26	I have always regarded Silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience .
28	I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... can you ?
15	This show is finally something new and interesting and ( most importantly ) funny !
24	This is a show I will never miss and it is one I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out .
22	If you do not know that she 's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints , you do not get it .
28	And if you do not get it , do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
29	All I can say is , if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie , then you are not human !
13	Even after watching it for the first time , I was hooked .
21	It is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe , as I am sure other fans will attest to .
20	After watching it , you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us .
10	At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them !
17	I think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with .
24	Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy , she does not stay in your heart the way Big and Little Edie do .
16	What a rare treat to have know such people ; I only wish I had !
6	Great acting , great movie .
11	If you are thinking of building see this movie first .
13	The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same .
18	The humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt .
20	I really can not remember who recommended this , but they said it was one of their favorite films .
14	It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident .
18	Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction , and the truth here is something to see .
19	I really can not understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year .
7	How can you improve on this ?
20	The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy remove themselves from New York Society and hide in the Hampton 's .
42	In the process they become recluses and what is best described as " crazy cat ladies . " They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie .
8	This film was done after that rescue .
36	All during , you could not help but think , " how bad was it before ? " It 's a look at high society from the darker side , and it is utterly fascinating .
11	One of the best love stories I have ever seen .
11	It 's interesting how the train of research can flow .
18	I started out looking at an article about Cristo 's " The Gates " in Central Park .
14	The article stated that the Maysles had been Cristo 's filmographers for years .
13	Hmmm ... Then I got to looking at their body of work .
24	I believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation .
6	Grey Gardens sounded very interesting .
26	Video Station , in Boulder CO , is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock .
4	DVD and VHS .
19	Edith and Edie are women living in the past , and oh what a glorious past it was .
28	Edith had been well off , born a Bouvier , married well , had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties .
16	Her daughter Edie had been a débutante , a fashion model and had many beaus .
16	She never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate .
11	She seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind .
6	Worrying too much about things .
32	It is only a shadow of the world they live in though , because Jackie O. came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted .
14	It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out .
14	But , in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls .
18	If you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess .
12	The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative .
20	The viewer gets the impression that Edith likes to go nude , but she does not in the movie .
24	Edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings " Tea for Two " .
14	Edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56 .
11	It was a good movie , though not for everyone .
23	When the cat is urinating behind Edith 's portait she states , " at least someone is doing what they want " !
42	I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill , Jackie Kennedy 's sister and the cousin of these women , would encourage the Maysles ' to make " Big Edie " and " Little Edie " the subject of a film .
14	They certainly could be considered the " skeletons " in the family closet .
21	The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women .
33	I 'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating . ( i.e. " Are they nuts ? Or am I missing something ? " ) .
8	This movie is hard to come by .
6	Netflix does not have it .
5	Facets does , though .
22	When it first came out , this work by the Meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation .
38	Luckily , it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema , especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television , and the bad evolution of most direct cinema .
22	Really , at first , we must say that this is not really direct cinema , it is more cinema verité .
41	The difference between the two is very slight , but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary , we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers , and they do interact with the characters filmed .
12	This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation .
26	The Meysels have been allowed in the house , and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household .
13	And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed .
20	It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews .
32	Here , we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house , a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith .
31	Their house is a mess , litter and animals everywhere , faded colors and furniture all over the house , and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality .
41	These two people have lived with each other their whole life , and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention , but rather because they can not help talking to each other this way .
17	They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings , there is no need .
23	In the end , though , even as they blame each other for their lives , they really love each other deeply .
39	Edie says she does not want her mother to die , because she loves her very much , and Edith says that she does not want Edie to leave her because she does not want to be alone .
25	But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age , the two women can not help be girls .
14	They can not help being one the singer , the other the dancer .
11	Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera .
37	When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically " Where have you been all my life ? " she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills .
30	A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again , the way only the Meysels and few others could do .
14	Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for .
16	Even though their house was filthy , this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness .
39	Perhaps if Little Edie was not so hard on herself the first time things did not work out , losing her hair , her job , and the love of her life , she would have made it .
30	This somehow ties into what I believe is her mental illness : her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead .
16	These women were extraordinary , and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness .
8	Grey Gardens is a world unto itself .
28	Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation , eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their ( apparently ) shared bedroom .
12	Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughter 's elocution .
27	This is a Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights , as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 % real .
31	The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade ( other than that they were poor and clean ) .
30	They would bicker all day , grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men , work , and self-expression .
17	This film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship of this kind .
24	It is sad and voyeuristic , but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly .
34	It is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context -- remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion .
14	I first saw this movie in my plays & playwrights course at Tulane .
12	I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was .
15	It is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude .
30	It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for Little Edie 's rehabilitation to society .
19	In all , the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it 's portrayal of surprising beauty .
5	Two thumbs way up !
15	Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just could not really look away .
23	It was so strange , and funny and sad and sick and    . . really no words can describe .
8	The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre .
40	I found out about this film reading my Uncle John 's Great Big Bathroom Reader , by the Bathroom Reader 's Institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue .
16	This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed .
17	One should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits , which I am sure include curtains .
22	When I get old I almost wish to be just like Big Edie , thumbing my nose at normalcy and society .
21	I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens , before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name .
19	Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie , the musical would not make sense .
13	It did , but it also prompted me to rent the movie .
26	At first , I thought it was a train wreck , full of strange , shrieking characters , and it was exceedingly hard to watch .
28	But being able to stop it , digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary .
18	Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing .
10	Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age .
28	They have a relationship that will chill any woman ( and undoubtedly some men ) and make you re - examine your own dealings with your mother .
36	In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace , it 's fascinating to see the Mayleses ' work from three decades ago , and realize what an impact the film must have had .
21	I echo what other posters have said : how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family ?
23	But beyond that , how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion ?
11	Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped ?
20	I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track , which gave me additional insight into the film .
13	I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot .
19	After many subsequent viewings ( and purchase of the video ) it still makes me laugh out loud .
27	Yes , it 's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class America - but well executed is well executed .
25	But it 's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism , the baby boom and the nascent consumer age .
9	This film is no " guilty " pleasure .
29	Three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane Melvyn Douglas ; bemused Cary Grant ; daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters .
23	My favourite scenes - " It means we gotta blast " and " Miss Stellwaggen " and " This little piggy " .
3	Love it .
30	Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale ( Big Edie ) and her daughter ( Little Edie ) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis .
19	They live in a rodent infested , rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city .
14	It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric .
26	Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 .
11	The content is pretty much made up of two things .
31	The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer , actress , and dancer .
14	These discussions usually become very rhetorical , nonsensical , and often times amusing .
14	The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties .
18	Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it 's only the other who sounds bad .
23	In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling .
28	Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it .
31	The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus , coming each day to record ( and chuckle ) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about .
19	Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by .
13	Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in .
12	Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever .
13	For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness .
16	Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom .
12	Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable .
11	Grey Gardens is shocking , amusing , sad and mesmerizing .
18	I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past .
27	Their existence in a dilapidated mansion , ( which they had not left for more than fifteen years ) is both a comedy and a tragedy .
10	This is a film you will not soon forget .
25	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title .
13	It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films .
19	It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully .
20	It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world .
14	I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it .
30	It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales , a true aristocratic family .
30	It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all , cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table .
10	It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout .
10	A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family .
17	The money had gone but their airs and graces remained , as well as their beauty .
22	It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate .
39	Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie 's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper .
2	Unforgettable .
12	Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies .
9	They could not live together , nor apart .
26	Babbling constantly , sometimes at the same time , they hashed and re-hashed the past ; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda .
23	I found myself laughing at times , but mostly I was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were .
4	See this one .
6	Why should you watch this ?
12	There are certainly no reasons why you should not watch it !
8	This is a Mother 's day film .
9	This is why i so love this website !
12	I saw this film in the 1980 's on British television .
35	Over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life .
33	With barely a few key words to remember it by , i traced the film here , and much information , including the fact it 's about to become an off-Broadway musical !
20	Interestingly , unlike the previous comment maker , i do not remember finding this film sad , or exploitative .
27	On the contrary , the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength , honour and dignity .
12	Ironic you may think , considering the squalor of their lives .
17	In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a ' cult ' .
29	Over the years , as it faded in my mind , it shone the brightest , above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience .
26	It was such a deeply private expose , it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a New York musical .
14	But perhaps somewhere , the daughter will be amused by such an outcome .
26	It is she who will have the last laugh maybe . . ( They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O ' )
17	The expanded Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out .
40	I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared , you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too ; people just do not talk like that anymore .
50	I think as a documentary , it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute , Old Edie at least still seems aware of what 's going on to a certain degree ; could not She see the once spectacular home disintegrating ?
25	Yet the film 's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now , a real life Tennesse Williams one act .
5	Well worth your time .
20	Several years ago when I first watched " Grey Gardens " I remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp .
48	Years later I still laugh out loud when I watch it , but after many viewings I have come to see the beauty in the strange , twisted relationship between the inseparable " Big " Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter " Little " Edith Bouvier Beale .
26	Mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room East Hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term " Shabby Chic " .
34	With innumerable cats , raccoons and opossums as roommates this Aunt and Niece of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day .
19	The result is a hilarious , beautiful , sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule .
17	The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love .
12	And their lives an example of drive , determination and free-will .
15	This movie has more to recommend it than I can put down into words .
12	It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself .
38	This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale , a mother and daughter , who lived as recluses in their family mansion in East Hampton , NY from the mid-50s through the late 70s .
30	By the time the filmmakers find them , the mansion is falling apart , and the women , one 78 and the other 56 , share a squalid room .
19	The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin .
31	The women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition , but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there .
21	Her mother seems more resigned to her fate , to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions .
35	There are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead , from the pictures that show a happy family , to the grand portrait of the older Edie next to her bed .
42	From what we see of the house , most of the rooms in it are empty , the walls are cracking and falling apart , and " Little " Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on .
10	And of course there are numerous cats running around .
10	At its heart , this documentary is incredibly sad .
21	While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life , the squalor they live in is utterly awful .
30	It 's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house , and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family .
19	However , as a documentary , the film is a wonder to behold , and is highly recommended .
48	I stopped short of giving " Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House " 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit : the fact that a black person is the faithful servant ( somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit ) .
11	But other than that , the movie 's a hoot .
33	Portraying middle class New York couple Jim ( Cary Grant ) and Muriel Blandings ( Myrna Loy ) trying to build a house in Connecticut , this flick has something for everyone .
17	Grant is his usual flippant self , while Loy does quite well as merely a wife .
29	But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jim 's and Muriel 's lawyer Bill Cole , who seems to have more plans than he 's making clear .
28	As for the house itself ... throughout most of the movie , you will probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there .
15	The builders , contractors , and others also provide their fair share of laughs .
8	All in all , a comedy classic .
17	Also starring Louise Beavers , Reginald Denny , Sharyn Moffett , Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
21	I saw this film a couple of weeks ago , and it 's been stuck in my head ever since .
13	It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary .
28	To get the true story of the Beales , I had to wade through all of the DVD 's bonus material and commentaries and search the web .
36	Although the Maysles and their fans ( not to mention Edith and Edie themselves ) bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative , this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word .
44	Very little effort is every made to explain the Beales or how they came to the condition they were in - the Maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous .
15	The sound , even on the Criterion re-release is poor and difficult to follow .
30	To paraphrase a review in the New Yorker , there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives , and a documentary was not one of them .
25	As for Edith and Edie , the thing I kept thinking while watching the film was " where the hell is their family " ?
11	They were living in dangerous , unhealthy , unsafe conditions .
36	How is it that Jackie O , married to one of the richest men on Earth ( or the wealthy Bouvier family themselves ) could not afford to get Edith and Edie a decent home ?
22	Or at the very least hire a part-time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both ?
13	It 's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family .
18	Although this review may sound negative I would strongly recommend Grey Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries .
38	Perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary - bringing in the rich backstory ( and afterstory ) of the Beales and the whole subsection of Hamptons society in the 1970 's .
5	What a strange film .
47	The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island ( Suffolk Co. ) and share the house with raccoons , cats , fleas ( eyow ! ) and who knows what else .
24	Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right .
43	Anyway , this is one strange pair , Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie ( the daughter ) always wears something over her head and dances , sings , and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense .
47	Big Edie ( the mother , age 79 ) apparently likes to run around naked , and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully ( ? ) done to the point where we are mercifully spared from that .
28	These women talk and talk and talk , mostly about the past , and it does not make a whole lot of sense , except to them .
40	They live in absolute filth , cats doing their business wherever ( " Look , that cat 's going to the bathroom behind my portrait ! " ) , and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations .
38	If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie 's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt , who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent .
30	One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent , lovely , you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested .
21	This is equal parts creepy , sad , and disgusting , but I could not stop watching once I started .
19	This is not my " normal " type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating .
10	It will not be for everybody though , guaranteed .
19	Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros . have chosen to document .
19	They seem like characters out of a Fellini film , only stranger , if that makes any sense .
20	Old Edie is almost fully bedridden , a pile of papers , clothes and dirty dishes growing around her .
7	Little Edie is even more interesting .
20	She prances around the house , always wearing a baboushka-like headdress around her head , completely covering her hair .
22	We never see her hair throughout the film , nor do we ever get a hint that she still has much .
16	At age fifty eight , though , she is still beautiful and full of life .
25	In Grey Gardens , we get the sense that both of these women 's lives have become much less than what they once were .
10	Little Edie is probably the sadder of the two .
12	At 58 , she still longed to find her prince charming .
32	If anything Little Edie is still a little girl , full of dreams of glamour and fame , and of domestic and romantic bliss , that have yet to be fulfilled .
47	Highlights of the film include the opening moments , where Little Edie explains her outfit to the camera , the " tea for two " sequence , the birthday party , the climactic argument , the grocery deliver scene , and the scene in the attic .
9	The whole thing is incredibly candid and unpretencious .
14	And it 's made all the more remarcable since it 's all real .
14	I suggest seeing Grey Gardens back-to-back with the Kenneth Anger short Puce Moment .
13	The Criterion DVD is $35.00 , but it 's worth every penny .
14	One of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today .
33	One question that must be asked immediately is : Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis ?
7	The answer is : Probably not .
17	But , thankfully , they are ( or were ) the cousin and aunt of Jackie .
25	Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton , New York , that is slowly decaying around them .
9	The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle .
38	Magnificent oil painting lean against the wall ( with cat feces on the floor behind them ) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines .
19	Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others .
7	Clothing is seems to be optional .
31	Edie 's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head .
17	As Edith says " Edie is still beautiful at 56 . " And indeed she is .
19	There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there .
9	There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension .
11	Their eating habits are ( to be polite ) strange .
6	Ice cream spread on crackers .
19	A dinner party for Edith 's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils .
26	Time is irrelevant in their world ; as Edie says " I do not have any clocks . " Their relationships with men are oh-so-strange .
12	Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness .
45	I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not , this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes .
18	Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you will never forget it , but very disturbing .
20	We stumbled upon the documentary , Grey Gardens , last Sunday and got " sucked in " without warning .
9	Spellbinding ! a must see ! ! ! !
28	Trawling through the Sci Fi weeklies section of the local Video Rentals store I was losing hope of finding any good movies I had not yet seen .
13	Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse .
21	My son is so jaded with current " B " Science Fiction that he has not bothered seeing this yet .
18	It must be noted I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia .
12	It must have been very quiet or I just missed it .
8	Well this WAS a really pleasant surprise !
7	This is also no B movie .
38	It 's not a " blockbuster " of the epic variety and does not try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it 's plot to be fully savoured .
47	The special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously CGI at first view , but they get it right at it 's 2nd appearance , & that aside everything else is top notch .
8	In any case the affects are secondary .
10	I will not give anything away about the plot .
22	The plot structure has a Russian Doll aspect a little reminiscent of Basic Instinct ( though with very different content ) .
16	Just I will say that Choosing Jeremy Northam for the lead was a master stroke .
34	The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND , and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect , it 's a tad off key .
19	See the final twist of the plot and you will see why that is such a brilliant choice !
22	And Lucy Liu is also just right with her " will she kiss me - will she shoot me " edge .
15	I rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them .
17	Do not read anything about this movie ( especially nothing that could contain any spoilers ) .
20	Just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you will have a really great experience .
46	If you like to see an intelligent , twisted story : Go , get the DVD and you will truly not be disappointed . " Cypher " is not really a sci-fi movie , more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business .
21	It 's about corporate secrets , how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them .
21	The actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness .
37	Cypher is much deeper , more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much , much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali 's other movies " Cube " and " Nothing " .
30	Actually it 's one of the best movies I have ever seen ( and that 's something I really do not say this about every fifth well-made flick ) .
18	Sorry , can not tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience .
9	Just give it a chance . ; - )
21	" Cypher " is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in America in the not too distant future .
22	While thematically not complex , this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty , ruthlessness , and corporate conspiracy .
29	To a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf .
31	The film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man , Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ) , who applies to the Digicorp group to work as an undercover operative .
49	After an initial briefing with Digicorp 's Security Chief , Sullivan is then given a new identity ( Jack Thursby ) and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies .
25	Upon successfully completing his first assignment , Sullivan / Thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered .
40	However , on one of his " business trips " he inadvertently runs into a woman named Rita Foster , ( Liu ) whom he had met on his previous assignment , and from there things go extremely topsy-turvy .
28	Vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic / household settings , while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up .
9	I was also very impressed with Jeremy Northam .
29	Not too often have I seen him in the lead role , and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of Wisconsin was brilliant .
25	Personally , I think he 's one of the many under used actors in the industry who has not been given more challenging roles .
17	Lucy Liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak-and-dagger tone .
38	Additionally , the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job , however , my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated .
27	With a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work , this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future .
15	I am surprised that I had never watched this " hidden gem " before .
22	This is a brilliant , not-too-overly complicated spy thriller , and therefore I am giving it a 9 out of 10 .
4	Or was it ?
43	Time , of course , has a way of modifying perspectives , and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary , there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older , seemingly less provocative films .
26	In " Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House , " there may , therefore , be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 .
8	There is political commentary , however subtle .
25	Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience , only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like .
5	Politics in the movie ?
30	The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school ( which in real life would get teachers accused of communism ) .
20	In real life , too , Myrna Loy was a housing activist , a Democrat , and a feminist .
35	Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand : he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas , whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism ( and which ruined her ) .
22	Jason Robards , sr. , has a small role in the film , but his political activism was no less noticeable .
22	More importantly , his son , Jason Robards , jr. , would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat .
24	Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant , whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping .
20	But this was 1948 : Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner .
20	It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films , and then not so subtly .
12	Cypher is a clever , effective and eerie film that delivers .
25	Its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands .
19	Although one could immediately label the film a science fiction , there is a little more to it .
29	It has it 's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir / detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story .
23	The film , overall , plays out like it 's some kind of nightmare ; thus building and retaining a good atmosphere .
41	Going with the eeriness stated earlier , Cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective , noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there is something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well .
18	There is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story .
48	The whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-Cold war ; something that resembles the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. in their war of word 's heyday and it really pulls through given the black , bleak , often CGI littered screen that I was glued to .
17	Cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film .
40	To say it resembles the first Jason Bourne film , only set in the sci-fi genre , is not cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities ; despite them both being released in the same year .
42	Like I mentioned earlier , there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict , you will find yourself enjoying this film .
36	Although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built ( or bought ) to your specifications , it is not the first , nor the last .
29	In 1940 Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart .
18	And about fifteen years ago Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE MONEY PIT .
18	The former was about moving into an 18th Century country house that ... err , needs work .
14	The latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s .
28	Although the two films have their moments , both are not as good as BLANDINGS , which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name .
40	Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel ( Cary Grant and Myrna Loy ) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment , which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy ( Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall ) .
32	He and Muriel take a drive into the country ( Connecticut ) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want .
18	And they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to .
47	For one thing , they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise , if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole ( Melvin Douglas , in a nicely sardonic role ) .
38	For example , Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer ( Ian Wolfe , sucking his chops quietly ) , with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of Connecticut .
21	Bill points out he 's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth .
32	There are problems about water supply that both Blandings just never think about , such as hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis - Zis Water softening machine .
46	They find that the designs they have in mind , and have worked out with their architect ( Reginald Denny ) , can not be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by Muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for .
13	The escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils Jim .
50	He has been appointed to handle the " Wham " account ( " Spam " had become a popular result of World War II , in that the public started using it as a meat substitute , in the light of it 's success with the armed forces ) .
25	Jim can not get a grip on this ( he 's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him ) .
23	Jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of Bill to Muriel , although ( in this case ) Bill is blameless .
31	But he 's always around ( Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the clearheaded one , and that he 's keeping Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes ) .
31	All three have mishaps , the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house , just as the men have left for the day .
25	They can not open the door , and Jim ( in a panic ) tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram .
12	He breaks a window , and the door opens by itself .
15	The film works quite satisfactorily , with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves .
21	It is one film which ( despite changing price levels and salary levels ) really does not age at all .
15	After all , most Americans dream of owning their own home and always have .
35	A number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the paint job Parnell 's company has to do on the various rooms .
31	She carefully shows the distinct shades of red , blue , etc . she wants - even giving a polite Parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue .
21	The commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job .
14	They proudly called Loy " Mrs. Blandings " in the commercials ' introduction .
22	You can imagine though how the no-nonsense Parnell handles the situation afterward , when Loy leaves him with his paint crew .
16	Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it 's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick .
20	The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what 's going on .
13	The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive .
15	The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie .
22	The technology used in the movie is not overly impressive , however , the director makes good use of the props .
7	The character development is intentionally shallow .
17	The main character , Jeremy Northam , decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage .
28	It 's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it 's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end .
23	Damn , I have seen this movie for at least 4 times now and I still do not get bored watching it .
24	The visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me .
37	The CGIs are quite bad IMHO , but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just ... Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie .
15	The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable , the plot is so good .
40	However although , the movie had little flaws , like e.g. sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too " slow " , but I do not mean the scenic parts by that , I totally loved those .
15	This movie is a Gem because it moves with soft , but firm resolution .
29	I caution viewers that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms Liu is there , it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace .
13	It 's NOT about explosions , car chases , or flying bullets .
12	You must be patient and instead , note the details here .
12	It 's sedate because that 's what the Main Character is .
13	The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds .
14	I will not give spoilers -- because that destroys the point of watching .
30	The plot is what you have read from the other postings : an average white-collar guy , seeking change and adventure , signs on for a corporate spy job .
11	Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data .
5	Take it from there .
25	This movie starts at a surreal walk -- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential , underlying suburban paranoia .
6	Then it begins to accelerate .
19	The acting on all parts is superb -- and yes , some of the acts are caricature characters .
9	But they all fit , and they entertain .
28	And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft , soft key sinister theme : All is not right at the beginning .
12	And at the end : All is not what it seems .
25	Get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one -- and turn up the sound : This movie wants you to LISTEN .
6	This is my first comment !
6	This is a fantastic movie !
11	I watched it all by luck one night on TV .
23	At first 5 minutes i thought it was a B movie , but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was .
22	I suggested to some friends to see the movie , only to tell me that it was a bad B movie .
3	How wrong .
3	Superficial critiques .
12	I think that the movie is almost a product of genius !
27	The well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time .
22	I have seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot .
39	What you need to know is that you do not have to miss any minute of this movie , if you do not completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end .
16	The end is what makes this movie so good , you can not expect it .
5	Congratulations to the Producer !
15	Who can watch a movie , look at Lucy Liu and not be overjoyed .
10	That woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress .
11	That 's a tough combination to find now a days .
19	And Jeremy Northam . i heard his name plenty of times , but i never really noticed him .
27	My advice to Hollywood is : " use him more " . now about the movie : I watched it in one of my graveyard shift .
8	I do not recommend that to anyone .
24	It 's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that . i still can not believe i did not see the ending coming .
33	I am not gonna say what cause that will spoil the hole movie . although saying this is spoilment enough . now i am suppose to cast my vote about this movie .
26	I love the dark mystic story , the actors did a good job & i love the directors ( natali ) work in the past .
37	There is not a big audience for this kind of thing , that 's also pretty risky . you know what , i am just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this .
14	Then again , 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement .
2	WOW .
12	One of the greatest movies I have EVER - EVER seen .
4	Absolutely LOVED it !
13	Before the opening credits were done I was glued to the screen .
13	It 's a Sci-Fi thriller - AND edge of your seat Whodunnit .
2	Incredible .
8	I wish 'd it would never end .
7	Lucy Liu is a throwaway role .
6	Anyone could have played it .
12	The lead actor , Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky guy .
16	This movie appeals to me who loved War Games , Sneakers , and Track Down .
4	Incredible ! 8-22-06 .

40	You know the trend in these types of movies : nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot , the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again .
39	The events in " Cypher " supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world , where the major companies do not really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other 's thunder .
31	Company Digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity , only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor , the Sunways Corporation .
20	Sunways , on the other hand , constantly tries to unmask the Digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies .
35	In between this whole unprofitable business stands Morgan Sullivan ; a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who 's been selected by Sebastian Rooks ( the über-spy ) to diddle the secret policies of BOTH companies .
37	Trust me , it 's actually less complicated than it sounds and director Vincenzo Natali ( the dude from " Tube " ) carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters .
39	The first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated John Frankenheimer gem " Seconds "  starring Rock Hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style .
30	Even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60 's film , with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless .
30	There is also plenty of great action and suspense , most notably when Morgan soberly experiences how the Digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing-techniques during boring conventions .
41	The middle section of the film drags a little , mainly because you already realize that it 's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot-twists , and I hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not-so-distant future .
25	Jeremy Northam is perfectly cast and the adorable Lucy Liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side .
22	This movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named Digicorp .
28	This wimpy guy , Morgan ( Jeremy Northam ) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy .
21	He is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies ' plans .
34	Instead , Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman ( played by Lucy Liu ) and pretty much being double-crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent .
9	How will Morgan get himself out of this ?
16	Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster ( played by Lucy Liu ) ?
11	And more importantly , can Morgan make it out alive ?
2	Wow !
5	What a nifty movie !
13	I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie .
23	It is very suspenseful and you can feel Morgan 's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive .
21	The scene where they put this horrible contraption on Morgan 's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening .
24	Morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished .
21	From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses , he turns into a man actively fighting for his life .
10	The ending , wow , the ending is incredible !
7	The twist is so much fun !
9	It left me gasping and cheering like crazy !
17	Good performances from all around , especially from Jeremy Natham , Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett .
6	I highly recommend this film !
22	I am a male , not given to women 's movies , but this is really a well done special story .
29	I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person but she does one Hell of a fine job , while DeNiro is his usual superb self .
18	Everything is so well done : acting , directing , visuals , settings , photography , casting .
18	If you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner .
25	If you came into the film with expectations , throw them away now , because no amount of hype will do this film justice .
12	To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal .
38	It 's a spy thriller , has elements of noir , bits and pieces of action , science fiction , and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative , mind-bending plot twists , and gorgeous cinematography .
24	A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative , both in good and bad ways , of other movies .
29	But as they say , every story cribs from Shakespeare , so once you can get past that , you are in for a hell of a ride .
39	You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points , and while the set never becomes unbelievable , there are portions ( read : the elevator ) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals .
29	Do not misconstrue that to mean it 's on the same level as cheesy Sci-Fi channel movies , though , because this is on a much higher level .
12	If you are looking for action , you should turn away .
5	This is pure psychology .
31	But if you are willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience , by all means , DO IT NOW !
13	Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it !
29	Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent Cube , which is my personal favourite SF film of the 90s .
34	It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube , shot entirely on one set , and took this idea in fascinating directions .
33	I have been eagerly awaiting Natali 's follow-up , and although its taken five years for him to mount another project , I am delighted to say it was worth the wait .
33	Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man 's place in the world , and how through a completely logical chain of events , finds himself in a situation beyond his control .
28	I do not want to reveal too much about the plot , because one of the joys of Cypher is the different avenues it takes us down .
25	It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it 's head .
6	Cypher is such a film .
25	Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ) , one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet , is hired by the company DigiCorp .
13	They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars .
9	To his bewilderment , they are unbelievably boring .
10	Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese .
28	While Morgan is waiting for one seminar , he runs into Rita Foster ( an impeccably cast Lucy Liu ) , the definition of an ice maiden .
16	She gives him the brush-off , but there is something to her he finds irresistible .
13	That 's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in .
23	When Rita turns up at another one of Morgan 's seminars , she tells him his life is not what it appears .
11	And I am not saying anything more about the plot .
30	To do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us , as well as the tortuous path that 's so much fun to follow .
36	As with Cube , Natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people , taking them out of the familiar , and basically seeing what will happen when they are thrust into the unknown .
6	And Cypher follows similar patterns .
10	But it 's not a carbon copy of Cube .
7	It has it 's own inspiration .
16	Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories .
20	One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge .
30	When Morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle , it 's as much of a shock to us as it is to him .
15	One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is .
14	Natali 's direction is exceptional , with a deft hand on the reins .
36	There are some amazing camera angles from above , such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast , robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is Morgan standing outside .
27	All the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture , which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir .
7	The acting is uniformly excellent throughout .
16	Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity .
10	His performance is excellent because it 's so modulated .
11	He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes .
20	From a clinical , spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity .
15	David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube .
17	He resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from Men in Black .
19	His scene is one of the best because it 's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia .
23	He is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents , and it 's a fantastic piece of writing , brilliantly acted by Hewlett .
20	All he has to do is look at Morgan , and we are drawn into his complex mind game .
12	But it 's Lucy Liu who 's the scene stealer here .
17	Too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect .
17	But in Cypher , she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove .
14	Rita is an aloof , guarded femme fatale that Liu inhabits with relish .
30	I perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control , and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone .
21	Things come to a very gratifying end , that does not conclude on an ambiguous note the way Cube did .
7	But Morgan deserves his happy ending .
20	After he 's been put through the ringer like this , I cheered for him in the final scene .
20	It 's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes .
6	Cypher succeeds on all counts .
20	Engaging , shocking , always entertaining , it 's everything that Total Recall wanted to be but was not .
14	And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix .
6	A fine follow-up from Natali .
11	And now I am a committed fan of the man .
3	Superb stuff !
32	Director Vincenzo Natali 's Cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which , although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration , manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience .
17	In reality , however , the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities .
13	Morgan , along with his fellow conference attendees , is being brainwashed .
29	The drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma , during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities .
34	Once they are totally convinced that they are someone else , they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies , where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion .
31	But Digi Corp 's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire Rita Foster ( Lucy Liu ) , who opens Morgan 's eyes to what is really happening .
19	She gives Morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques .
28	She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is Jack Thursby , then he will be ' eliminated ' .
14	Morgan plays along , and applies for a job at rival business Sunways .
22	However , arriving at his new workplace , he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy .
26	Fortunately , the bosses at Sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent .
28	From hereon in , things get progressively more complicated ; the plot twists and turns and poor old Morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone .
22	In an exciting finale , all eventually becomes clear ( but only if you have been following events very carefully ) .
23	Director Natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget .
34	He manages to get some great performances from his talented cast ; Jeremy Northam , in particular , is fantastic  his portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous Morgan is played to perfection .
29	Cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and I eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects , High Rise and Necropolis .
21	Listen , I do not care what anybody says , as Cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie .
12	Cypher is not , I repeat not , a B movie .
6	Cypher is an absolute masterpiece .
26	Suffice it to say , I am a connoisseur of the world 's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight .
10	I can not overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is .
14	Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made .
12	The technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime .
16	In fact , I must admit that Cypher completely surprised the hell out of me .
17	In fact , I have recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie .
23	Other critics , of whom some downplayed the movie , have no idea as to what the hell they are talking about .
7	Do not listen to the haters .
16	And actually , for the most part , reviews of Cypher have been largely positive .
22	And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie , but it is also a fantastic movie .
29	Cypher is the kind of movie that 's so advanced and so magnificently crafted , that it 's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics .
11	There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever .
25	Again , the cinematography , the backdrops , the technology , the storyline , and the acting are all 100 % world-class top notch .
9	Naturally , I will not give anything away .
6	This is not a spoiler .
24	And though it is the contention of some critics that Cypher should have been in movie theaters , I believe quite the opposite .
22	Cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for DVD release only and not in a bad way .
16	Cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves .
27	Blade Runner , 1984 , Brave New World , Total Recall , Logan 's Run , Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... look out !
23	Cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research , 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame .
9	Cypher is counterespionage at it 's absolute best .
6	Hands down and hats off .
12	Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction .
5	The future is now .
44	In a near future , the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ) is hired by Digicorp , a huge corporation , to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors , Sunways .
21	Along his training , Morgan is brainwashed , assumes a new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures .
32	In one of them , he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster ( Lucy Liu ) , who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be .
16	Morgan acknowledges a new reality , where he does not know who can be trusted .
12	The unknown " Cypher " was a great surprise for me .
33	This movie has not been released in Brazil , but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex , with many plot points , and with great screenplay , direction and performances .
16	In the very last twist , I recalled Arnold Schwarzenegger 's " Total Recall " .
33	This movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once , and I really did not like the last scene , when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea .
24	In only know the director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic " Cube " , and this second work I see is also stunning .
5	My vote is eight .
7	Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
15	This is a superbly imaginative low budget Sci-fi movie from cult director Vincenzo Natali .
30	The film plays out like a crossing of Phillip K Dick with Hitchcock and Cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen .
19	The film is superbly shot , I love the cinematography in this , it feels fresh and original .
24	Plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like Total Recall , Dark City and the Matrix and its pretty staple Sci-fi stuff .
34	Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ) is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for Digicorp , a large technological corporation .
25	He meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings Sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do .
22	It basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen .
20	It also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife .
31	After his first job things become strange , his habits change , his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares .
25	He encounters a beautiful woman named Rita Foster ( played by an intriguingly cast Lucy Liu . ) he takes an instant attraction to .
34	However when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems .
21	He finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for Digicorp .
15	The conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies .
21	Digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence .
14	Sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now Jack Thursby .
32	Digicorp want to steal information from their rivals Samways and they want their own puppets to do it , they now effectively control what these spies do , except for Sullivan .
34	When Samways get a hold of Sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on Digicorp , make Sullivan a double agent .
41	They know that Digicorp have sent Thursby to them to work his way into Samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down .
35	Samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with Digicorp and allow Thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give Digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system .
17	The plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using Sullivan as a pawn .
24	He is stuck in the middle and Rita Foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him .
50	When a mysterious third party becomes involved , the person it is revealed that Foster works for , Sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent , who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for .
25	The tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires .
5	The cast are great .
12	Northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent .
31	He brings a great visual aspect to his performance , his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from Sullivan to Thursby .
29	Lucy Liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact .
9	The rest of the cast are also good .
19	Director Natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick Cube , has a real visual flair .
15	He paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look .
33	For a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the CGI is not great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively .
22	The film really does bring feelings of The Matrix and other great sci-fi films , it is up there with them .
30	The plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this , that is where the Cronenberg and Lynch influence is evident .
19	The film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along .
25	This is overall an obvious cult classic and I can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states . **** 1/2
12	This Filmfour funded Sci-Fi movie is most definitely a must see .
46	While it takes huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise ; it 's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive , despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film .
32	It 's good to know that films like this are still being made ( even if they are not getting wide releases ) , and Cypher is refreshing for that reason .
38	The plot twists and turns , which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher 's mystery .
39	The plot follows Morgan Sullivan ; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons , to him , unknown .
45	However , his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita ... This film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it 's apocalyptic imaging of the future .
37	This gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type , with it 's only real close affiliate being Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange .
24	The plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing .
21	You never quite know where you are with the plot , which serves in making it all the more intriguing .
23	The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars ; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui .
26	Northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale , and does well with his role .
30	Lucy Lui is an actress that has a resume that does not quite fit her talent , but she has a look about her that just fits this movie .
41	Cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent ; but on the whole , if you want an inventive recent Sci-Fi film ; Cypher is the way to go .
50	Jeremy Northam 's characterization of the stuttering , mild mannered bookish Morgan Sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of Lucy Liu 's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch .
31	His offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit , done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face , neck and lips .
12	No matter the brainwashing , love has a way of persevering .
17	Love also can not be " brainwashed in " with either of his two fake wives .
28	In gradual stages , he begins to dispense with his glasses , to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses .
14	The music is fantastic , hypnotic , sexy and appropriately driving at times .
28	The extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi " film noir " in the tradition of many classic thrillers .
32	She is just no match for Northam 's talents , but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author .
35	- Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City , Jim Blandings ( Cary Grant ) finds a property in the country for his wife and children .
9	He 's hoping to find the simple life .
12	But , building a house proves to be anything but simple .
15	As the headaches and the bills start piling up , so do the laughs .
32	Will Mr. Blanding 's ever get his dream house ? - What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant , Myrna Loy , and Melvyn Douglas .
26	Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own , so when you combine their talents , almost every scene is special .
14	Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role .
11	He is so good at playing the put upon husband .
9	Loy is a always a joy to watch .
13	The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect .
16	And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years .
26	Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House , a particular favorite of mine . - The movie is definitely a product of its time .
28	I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story , three bedroom , four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year .
9	And that 's where the comedy comes in .
48	How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected ? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole " wife in love with best friend " subplot .
17	It 's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented .
27	You will notice by the stars I have given this GREAT film that ' ... before you see it the first time , ' is implied .
34	I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week ( and last ) was a very slow rental experience ( not much great coming in ) .
22	I am not sure how this movie slipped past me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too .
5	Still , it did .
19	This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you do not have a large budget .
26	It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark ; just enough .
20	The entire film is you ( the viewer ) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns .
18	I would have given this film 10/10 , however some of the shots were pretty fake looking .
22	I do not hold that against this film too much , but I do not think it deserves a perfect score .
11	Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious ( as always ) .
11	I think she 's pretty underrated as a serious talent .
31	Nevermind her beauty ( which is difficult ) , she really takes her roles seriously and does not rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion .
14	And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed , as well .
26	Jeremy Northam does really well , at first , as quite a geeky corporate rat , willing to run through any maze to prove himself .
16	However , as he changes throughout the film , it 's like night and day .
37	I know some fans of Clive Owen , Jude Law , or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this , but Northam would / could / should fit that bill .
6	He 's suave and cultured .
10	He 's got a great Bond posture and voice .
21	I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it , and rather down-to-Earth , as well .
21	Great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films .
23	There was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups .
21	It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers .
17	This film also included one of the most imaginative " escape " scenes in recent years .
14	The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller .
25	Although the plotting of the film was convoluted , the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed .
33	In 1949 , George Orwell suggested in his famous novel " 1984 " that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian State , which would control minds and diminish human liberty .
29	It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film , it was not the State , but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker .
26	When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity , it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration .
22	That did not really happen , surprisingly , and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear .
13	But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit .
20	The story is of a Morgan Sullivan , who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called Digicorp .
23	His job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company , while under an assumed and false identity .
20	His home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he 's actually doing .
26	However , things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what 's going on , he starts to question who he actually is .
35	This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up ... Twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated , and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable .
26	It 's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future , and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat .
3	Highly recommended .
23	A major moneymaker for RKO Radio , Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots .
19	O'Brien and Scott argue over teaching methods , while their students vie for the affections of Anne Shirley .
11	O'Brien's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over Tokyo .
35	Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese , but the mortally wounded Scott manages to set fire to a gas truck , providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers .
19	I was not sure at first if I was watching a documentary , propaganda film or dramatic presentation .
15	I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three .
8	Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable .
18	But you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on .
15	We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment .
13	Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end .
21	The scenes had a realism ( at least as I perceived it ) that I have not encountered often before .
16	You could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants .
28	This was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real Japanese actors would be somewhat scarce .
23	The movie is excellent as a source of the state of the American mindset in 1943 as the war waged with Japan .
22	Also of interest was a dig at the Japanese with respect to the help the USA gave Japan in past years .
27	There were a lot of films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public .
31	Seen today , some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda -- which they technically are , but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation .
23	This film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre -- having a pretty realistic script and good production values .
29	Pat O'Brien plays pretty much the same character he played in MANY other films ( you know , the tough-talking , hard-driven but " swell guy " ) .
34	Randolph Scott is , as always , competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent ( look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombardiers in training ) .
29	While the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews , the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched .
23	That it , perhaps , except for the very end -- where the film is a bit over-the-top but also VERY satisfying .
27	I did like watching Cliffhanger , i think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and i think he will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky .
11	This movie is directed by Renny Harlin the finnish miracle .
5	Stallone is Gabe Walker .
10	Cat and Mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists .
8	Renny Harlin knows how to direct actionmovie .
10	Stallone needed this role to get back on track .
30	Snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow , ice , cold and bad weather than finnish man .
4	Action is good !
7	Music in the film is spectacular .
25	The bad guy is John Litghow , other stars Micheal Rooker ( The portrait of serialkiller ) , Janine Turner ( Strong Medicine ) .
13	The is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie .
18	Overall good movie **** / ***** Remember Extreme ääliöt : special collectors edition , with good extras .
8	Comig soon in Finland straight to video .
8	Good action show , but nothing new .
17	This one took place high in the mountains , which showed some nice scenery and such .
18	One man takes on a group of mercenaries , the lead flies , and he kicks butt .
18	It could have been called " Rambo Goes to the Rockies " , it was that pat .
21	It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror .
15	Not a bad picture , but just same ol ' , same ol ' .
19	This movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded .
48	This movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights , a very fit Stallone putting in a good performance as well , an exciting plot , and a great performance from it 's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways .
16	The movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play .
27	The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special human , much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters .
25	They chose to humanise Stallone 's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot 's style , weakens the excitement factor .
12	Also , the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times .
13	The script should have been more realistic and less " talky " .
9	Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes .
17	The movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses .
22	They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie .
33	Instead , they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences ( ala " A-Team " TV series ) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops .
11	This movie had a lot of all time great potential .
27	Crisper action sequences , better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky style emotion / determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level .
9	I know this was not Stallone 's fault .
37	I sense the movie 's director wanted to tone down Stallone 's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer .
6	Sill a good movie though ........
9	This movie is really nerve racking Cliffhangin movie !
6	Stallone was good as always !
15	Michael Rooker put on a surprising performance and John Lithgow play a excellent villain !
8	The music is fantastic especially the theme !
9	The movie is action packed and never dull !
16	If you are a Stallone fan then watch Cliffhanger , you will not be disappointed !
38	While the prices have gone up a lot , and some of the details have become dated , any homeowner who 's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie .
5	I know I did .
26	Mr. Blandings , a New York ad executive , decides to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there .
31	He gets into one hilarious jam after another , from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties , as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control .
19	I thought that the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water .
12	They dig down hundreds of feet , but never find water .
19	Yet only a short distance away , a few days later , the basement of his house-to-be floods !
34	Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give believable performances as the harried Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined , and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding 's lawyer and family friend .
14	The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 .
34	Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she 's causing , and there is a black maid ( horrors ! ) .
22	So do not watch this movie through the social lens of 2003 , and you will enjoy it all the more .
20	Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone 's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor .
31	It 's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars .
20	It has great action sequence 's , edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .
14	After the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber ( Michelle Joyner ) .
26	Eight months has passed ... The Rocky Mountain Rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind Eric Quaien ( John Lithgow ) .
13	Quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside .
39	Two experienced climbers Walker ( Sylvester Stallone ) and Tucker ( Micheal Rooker ) and a helicopter pilot ( Janine Turner ) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by Quaien and his men .
18	Now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek .
19	While Quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped Tucker to find the money .
11	Once Tucker finds the money , Tucker will be dead .
10	Against explosive firepower , bitter cold and dizzying heights .
7	Walker must outwit Quaien for survival .
25	Directed by Renny Harlin ( Driven , Mindhunters , A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master ) made an entertaining non-stop action picture .
20	This film is a spectacular , exciting , visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well .
10	This was one of the biggest hits of 1993 .
9	This is one of Harlin 's best film .
7	Lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain .
11	Stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller .
11	This is probably Harlin 's best work as a filmmaker .
18	DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound .
14	DVD has an running commentary track by the director with comments by Stallone .
9	DVD also has technical crew commentary as well .
18	DVD has behind the scenes featurette , two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more .
8	Do not miss this great action film .
18	Screenplay by Micheal France ( Fantastic Four ) and actor : Stallone ( The Rocky Series ) .
8	Based on a premise by John Long .
17	Excellent Cinematography by Alex Thomson , B.S.C. ( Alien ³ , Demolition Man , Legend ) .
14	Oscar Nominated for Best Sound , Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects .
8	Panavision . ( **** / ***** ) .
45	After the success of Die Hard and it 's sequels it 's no surprise really that in the 1990s , a glut of ' Die Hard on a ..... ' movies cashed in on the wrong guy , wrong place , wrong time concept .
31	That is what they did with Cliffhanger , Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly ' Stop or My Mom Will Shoot ' Stallone 's career .
27	Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream , especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing , base-jumping , aviation , facial expressions , acting skills .
19	All in all it 's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk .
10	Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse !
34	However , if you an forget all the nonsense , it 's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills , and unintentionally , plenty of laughs .
38	You have got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness , his tick every box band of baddies , and best of all , the permanently harassed and hapless ' turncoat ' agent , Rex Linn as Travers .
48	Mention too must go to former ' London 's Burning ' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy , who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football , yes , you can not help enjoy that bit , Hal needed a good kicking .
28	So forget your better judgement , who cares if ' that could never happen ' , lower your acting expectations , turn up the volume and enjoy !
16	And if you are looking for Qaulen , he 's the one wearing the helicopter .
37	As Roger Ebert wrote ( about another film ) " It 's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you do not make the mistake of thinking too much . "
42	The selection of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo .
13	But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion .
32	The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill , suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws .
25	The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before .
24	The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation .
16	The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end .
23	Good movies are not made every year and people do not get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then .
39	Apart from the filthy language / parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes , the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years .
6	This movie is just great .
25	It 's entertaining from beginning to the end , you are always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie .
12	In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics .
15	Sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy Gabe Walker .
13	Together with him Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker .
20	And then , John Lithgow , one of the best performances I have seen of him as a villain .
31	And the fact that 75 % of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action !
3	Brilliant movie !
29	Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker the expert climber especially in the action / fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic .
14	For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief .
33	The rest of the cast including John Lithgow , Michael Rooker , Janine Turner , Rex Linn , Caroline Goodall , and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie .
24	The action / fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some are not very realistic no matter how tough you are .
45	The climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie .
11	The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable .
26	The villains are solid but it would 've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them .
19	The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one .
21	If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone 's than chances are you will enjoy this one too .
34	Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action , drama , some suspense , excitement , thrills , and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch .
7	Was this based on a comic-book ?
3	A video-game ?
7	A drawing by a 3 year-old ?
29	There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all ; not the characters , not the dialog , not the plot , not the action .
2	Nothing .
35	We have high-tech international terrorists / criminals who bicker like pre-school kids , Stallone 's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather , dialog so dumb that it 's sometimes almost hilarious , and so on .
16	Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ( " tango-tango " ) .
18	A film that entertains through some suspense , good action-sequences , and a nice snowy mountainous setting .
9	Oh , yes : and the unintentional humour .
27	The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a " swell " time .
21	Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part , which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out .
17	And then we have some more bad dialog , and after that some more great action .
11	This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell .
40	Stallone 's melodramatic exchange with Turner , when they meet after a long time , is so soapy , so clichéd , so fake , and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer .
22	Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing , we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane .
17	The entire action is one big absurdity , but it 's mindless fun at its best .
22	Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun , the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film .
18	After the landing , our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker .
12	DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT ? ? ?
3	Very silly .
24	Apparently they do not trust Stallone , but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage .
33	Nevertheless , our gangsters make Stallone 's climb difficult , if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts .
27	And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are , they overact , brag , and snicker in a truly evil manner .
3	Everyone convinced ?
2	Good .
5	You 'd better be .
30	Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children , just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone .
18	The old guy who flies the chopper ... How the hell did he fall for the trap ?
32	Firstly , he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals , and secondly , he must have heard Stallone 's and Rooker 's voices on the walkie-talkies .
24	They are very creative about it ; they philosophize , pretend that they are playing football with your body , and so on .
5	Stallone co-wrote this thing .
14	I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it .
15	I 'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.
14	Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite .
16	Since then I have seen it countless times and I never get tired of it .
38	The setting has a lot to do with it ( the Colorado I know would be jealous ) , but the storyline is original and I liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes .
12	There has not been a movie I can compare this too .
33	John Lithgow plays a smart villain , but I love how he is completely out of his element -- he has to follow Tucker around and that 's what keeps it interesting .
10	This is an action movie at it 's BEST .
13	I do not think I will see another that is so entertaining .
14	You do not need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie .
11	It just has to keep you captivated , not shell-shocked .
21	To be honest , I did not like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time .
16	But I guess the trouble is that I have not seen it in a theater .
3	Big Mistake !
17	Because the #1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography .
16	Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system .
19	The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level ( and a commercial potential ) .
12	The more I see it , the more I like it .
11	It 's definitely one of Renny Harlin 's best movie .
6	THis guy knows about action .
12	Die Hard 2 , The long kiss good bye , etc .
9	And it 's particularly good in this movie .
8	The special effect are great and spectacular .
10	Stallone really needed that movie get back with success .
6	Still good to see him !
37	In Manhattan , the American middle class Jim Blandings ( Cary Grant ) lives with his wife Muriel ( Myrna Loy ) and two teenage daughters in a four bedroom and one bathroom only leased apartment .
25	Jim works in an advertising agency raising US $ 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space .
43	When he sees an advertisement of a huge house for sale in the country of Connecticut for an affordable price , he drives with his wife and the real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice .
36	His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole ( Melvyn Douglas ) sends an acquaintance engineer to inspect the house , and the man tells that he should put down the house and build another one .
46	Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the American Dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice , while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend .
24	In 1986 , Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic , " The Money Pit " .
5	My vote is eight .
19	Title ( Brazil ) : " Lar , Meu Tormento " ( " Home , My Torment " )
35	I am far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3 , which is an almost inexistent small role .
21	And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad , even though I feared the worst .
43	When Gabe ( Stallone ) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top , he can not possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger .
19	For almost a year he does not set a food in the reserve , but than he returns .
24	Soon after he 's back , they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm .
10	At least , that 's what the rangers believe .
33	In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed .
43	The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them ... This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever , but in its genre it 's an enjoyable one .
18	I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers .
26	I know him best from the TV-series " 3rd Rock from the Sun " , but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well .
30	Overall the acting is OK , it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners , but it also offered a very nice decor .
10	This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment .
41	I loved the snowy mountains and valleys , the mountain rivers and the forests ... Perhaps that 's why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind .
6	I give it a 6.5/10 .
14	If you do not expect too much , this is an enjoyable movie .
42	Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations , Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings .
41	The opening sequence has already received substantial praise , all of which it deserves : its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening .
13	The next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet .
42	As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin , the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not : the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected .
21	As Roger Ebert has observed , the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition .
29	Later , during the avalanche sequence , one of the terrorists / thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain .
42	So far as I know , no one was killed in the making of this movie ( a small miracle , considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts ) , so obviously a dummy was used for the shot .
31	But the shot itself remains impressive because we are left wondering how Harlin ( or more likely one of the second-unit directors ) knew exactly where to place the camera .
38	The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone 's acting strengths : he plays an older , more vulnerable kind of action hero , giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself .
32	In contrast to many of today 's post-Matrix , comic book-inspired action heroes , Stallone 's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities .
28	In Cliffhanger , the hero almost freezes to death , and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another .
31	He winces when he 's hit and bleeds when he 's cut , particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains .
21	Even if Cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside , it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show .
41	Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means , but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it had not given Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor .
41	Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or ( at times ) a Western , Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film .
46	Besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before , the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow , as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative .
27	Finally , Harlin 's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless , since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes .
35	It 's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies , because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like years later .
29	But perhaps it 's best that Cliffhanger stands on its own for all time , without a sequel : there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already .
26	There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit : compared to that clinker , Cliffhanger belongs on the IMDb 's Top 250 list .
17	Rating : 8 ( Very good , especially considering most of Stallone 's other movies . )
18	This film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film !
18	The plot is somewhat lacking , but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference .
14	This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please .
31	As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining ; and with major stars like Cary Grant , Myrna Loy , and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong ?
19	Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued , and is very difficult to imitate .
26	A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film : The Money Pit , with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long .
21	Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars , the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments .
8	Achieving true comedic dialog is an art .
9	Sly 's best out and out action film .
21	It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters , solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured .
22	Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes .
29	This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90 's , a definite genre classic .
15	As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories .
12	Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form .
18	Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film .
20	The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner , Michael Rooker and John Lithgow . ****
40	I do not think I will ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin . ' Die Hard 2 ' was cool , and he gave the world ' Cliffhanger ' , one of the most awesome action movies ever .
19	That 's right , you little punks , ' Cliffhanger ' rules , and we all know it .
44	Sly plays Gabe Walker , a former rescue climber who is ' just visiting ' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend , Hal Tucker ( Michael Rooker ) , assist in a rescue on a mountain peak .
29	Walker obviously came back at a convenient time , because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen ( John Lithgow ) .
42	Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back ... Essentially , ' Cliffhanger ' is another ' Die Hard ' clone .
35	Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains , complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal .
39	Naturally , that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough , as Stallone 's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease , and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects .
26	After all , is not that what action movies are all about ? ' Cliffhanger ' is one of the most exciting action movies around .
8	A showcase of great scenes and stunts .
44	One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I have ever seen in a movie , and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning , it maintains its action awesomeness .
13	John Lithgow 's lead villain is entertaining , and one bad dude .
37	Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever . ' Cliffhanger ' is easily one of Stallone 's best efforts , definitely Renny Harlin 's best effort , and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
19	Eric Valette is obviously a talented film-maker , and so are the two guys who wrote the script .
19	Therefore Maléfique is a great flick , made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination .
14	Well , I am a bit exaggerating , but nevertheless I am sincere .
16	So , if you like dark , gory movies , go and see this one .
6	It 's really worth it .
37	After a brick falls from the wall of the cell , the men discover the hidden journal written by a ' Fountain of Youth ' - obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s .
9	Is this journal the secret to their escape ?
10	Or is there something much more sinister behind it ?
45	I was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the dreadful One Missed Call ( 2008 ) , which I consider to be the worst theatrically released film I have ever seen .
48	However , much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan 's awful script , because ( as I remember ) Valette 's direction was not the worst part about the film ( unless he chose to include the baby ) .
44	Anyway , Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back . . . it 's a French film ( obviously something I like ) and it takes place in prison ( which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums ) .
13	So that 's two points for him before the film even starts .
12	Luckily , Valette had me once the film ended as well .
29	Maléfique is a rather deep , rather complex , rather compelling story of obsession and desperation . . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality .
23	While it 's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense , the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening .
42	The period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film I have seen in quite some time and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore .
5	Final verdict : 8.5/10 .
10	Quite a bit of respect earned back by Valette .
17	Note : Paramount picked up the rights to make an American remake ( surprise surprise ) .
7	It 's due out in 2009 .
28	I am not sure why , to be honest , as this does not seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states .
8	But , I have been surprised before .
6	Vive La France ! -AP3 -
4	A prison cell .
41	Four prisoners-Carrere , a young company director accused of fraud,35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation , Daisy , a 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and Lassalle , a 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wife .
37	Behind a stone slab in the cell , mysteriously pulled loose , they discovered a book : the diary of a former prisoner , Danvers , who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century .
31	The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape . " Malefique " is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films I have seen this year .
26	The film has a grimy , shadowy feel influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft , which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere .
25	There is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed .
25	It 's a shame that Eric Valette made truly horrible remake of " One Missed Call " after his stunning debut.9 out of 10 .
29	The movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may , if read right , get them out .
25	As prisons go , the cell was totally unrealistic , so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things .
11	It also moves rather slowly , which may bore people .
35	But other than that , this is top notch horror feeling , mixing Sartre 's " hell is other people " with a Lovecraft / Barker type of story , and doing rather successfully .
10	Bottom line : take the time to watch this .
22	That means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else .
14	This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it .
16	Lessons to be learned : Yog is bad , almost as bad as French women .
8	I was hooked from beginning to end .
21	I was telling other people about this movie days after I had seen it just because it still haunted me .
35	I even had a bad dream after seeing it , and I am a true horror fan , not easily spooked by tripe like " The Grudge " or even " Silent Hill " .
26	What gave me the bad dreams was the unease I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with those guys .
19	What would my personal horror be ? my subconscious took me there , and it was not pleasant .
13	That my friends is what a good horror flick does to you !
12	The best part of this movie is that it is subtle .
19	It 's not about Bogeymen that jump out at you , alien invasions , or tons of gore .
5	It 's the opposite .
9	The horror you create in your own mind .
24	The irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it 's power over them .
25	Simply , the men ask for the one thing they desire , and they get it ... but not in the way they imagined .
25	So on the one hand , they get what they wish for from an occult book , but may ultimately wish they had not .
14	Sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be !
11	Now this is what I 'd call a good horror .
20	With occult / supernatural undertones , this nice low-budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene .
19	This proves you do not need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie .
35	The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison , and each of these characters ( and their motives ) become gradually more interesting , as the movie builds up tension to the finale .
30	Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere , who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates .
16	I will not say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen .
46	There a few flaws though : the FX are not that good , but they are used effectively ; the plot leaves some mysteries open ; and things get very confusing towards the end , but Malefique redeems itself by the time it 's over .
10	I thought his was a very good movie , 8/10
13	Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it .
41	The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier , somehow without leaving his cell .
30	As they look through the diary , they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom .
17	What they find out , is something completely different , and horrifying to say the least .
22	I like low-budget horror films , that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way , and tell a good story .
14	This movie does just that , despite taking a while to get going .
19	The result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me , and I enjoyed the ride .
23	Not a lot of gore , but that would not fit the story , although the gore it has is pretty good .
49	This film centers on four criminals , locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell , hoping that a mysterious book of black magic , penned by a former inmate around 1920 , named Danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young .
26	The film follows Carrère as he reads from the book , attempting to understand it 's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison .
20	Carrère loves his child , and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail .
23	When she betrays him , Carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate , and longing to see and hold his beloved son .
33	Carrère 's toughest critic is Marcus , who longs to be fully female , while still folding to several masculine traits , such as working out and taking a leak standing up .
23	He talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic , although deep inside is a world of vulnerability .
30	Pâquerette is completely under Marcus ' control and behaves like a canine to it 's master . . there is even an alarming scene where Pâquerette breast-feeds from Marcus !
25	Lassalle is an unraveling mystery , opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain .
29	Clearly intellectual , and holding possible secrets from the others , Lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going .
37	Soon , those who are not a threat to the book seek their " true " escape , not as much from the cell of four walls , but the cell that imprisons their true desires .
25	A constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach .
12	I am glad I had a chance to watch this film .
25	It does play out like " Monkey 's Paw " , the characters get what they desire , but a price must be met .
28	There is gore in the film , startling moments of graphic violence , but , in my opinion , this is first and foremost a story-driven tale .
11	The gore is a product of what the book unleashes .
32	One of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air , while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man 's desire .
21	We see Danver 's fate at the end , with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away .
9	Lassalle 's fate is a masterful effects sequence .
26	I guess that 's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations , not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them .
19	One night , Carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell .
26	They realize that the book was written by Danvers ( Geoffrey Carey ) in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic .
39	They decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison , when they find the truth about Danvers ' fate . " Maléfique " is an original , intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror movie .
26	The story is practically in the same location , does not have any clichés and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene .
50	I am a great fan of French cinema , usually romances , dramas and police stories , but I noted that recently I have seen some good French horror movies , such as " Un Jeu d ' Enfants " , " Belphegor " and " Dead End " .
5	My vote is seven .
18	Title ( Brazil ) : " Sinais do Mal " ( " Signs of the Evil " )
15	Malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere .
29	Nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest .
32	Soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell .
20	From here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison .
17	That leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light .
25	Honestly I think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together .
22	Anyway I was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast .
35	The kills are raw and eerie ... its does not take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in Hellraiser .
12	Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint .
46	At times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger ... when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on Marcus breasts it seems normal , so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be ?
26	With its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do .
13	I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale .
32	Several elements like the visitor with the camera , the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end do not fit tight in the story .
45	Anyway , I will keep my eyes open for other movies from director Valette , although its a turn-off to see he 's is doing a Hollywood remake of " One missed call " which was worn off and useless already in the Miike-version .
18	Good horror movies from France are quite rare , and it 's fairly easy to see why !
29	Whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film , he emigrates towards glorious Hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic !
44	Eric Valette 's long-feature debut " Maléfique " was a very promising and engaging horror picture too , and he 's already off to the Hollywood as well to direct the remake of Takashi Miike 's ghost-story hit " One Missed Call " .
16	The film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters .
12	We are inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants .
42	The new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud , the elderly and " wise " inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there is a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome .
33	They find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell , belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920 's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape .
25	Watch it before some wealthy American production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals .
30	French horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as Inside and Switchblade Romance bursting on to the scene .
30	Maléfique preceded the revival just slightly , but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best French horror films ever made !
48	Maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget , but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film , and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner .
13	The plot focuses on two main ideas ; prison and black magic .
15	The central character is a man named Carrère , sent to prison for fraud .
25	He is put in a cell with three others ; the quietly insane Lassalle , body building transvestite Marcus and his retarded boyfriend Daisy .
24	After a short while in the cell together , they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal .
28	After translating part of it , they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls .
36	Black Magic is a very interesting topic , and I am actually quite surprised that there are not more films based on it as there is so much scope for things to do with it .
33	It 's fair to say that Maléfique makes the best of it 's assets as despite it 's restraints , the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout .
42	The film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot ; the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done .
29	Anyone worried that the film will not deliver by the end will not be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying !
22	Overall , Maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - HIGHLY recommended viewing !
7	Maléfique is a very interesting movie .
10	It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures .
46	The central concept is great , three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth ( who the audience identify with ) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell .
33	The atmosphere is well-woven , it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes ' in the Château d'If ( prior to becoming the Count of Monte Cristo ) .
46	The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell , particularly the character we are meant to identify with ( Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified , but it 's obliquely suggested might be fraud ) .
31	On one occasion Carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him ; we never leave the cell , the claustrophobia is unbroken .
28	There are also no shots of the prison outside the cell , and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall .
21	So even though the film appears to be very modern , it has a very old world feel of incarceration .
5	The characters are intriguing .
26	We have Marcus , a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to Pâquerette ( French for Daisy ) a heavily retarded young man .
33	Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful , and unfortunately this included his baby sister , hence his current predicament ( I like this comment on internalisation , very primitive ) .
16	Lasalle is a withdrawn , possessed elderly man , in for brutally murdering his wife .
24	The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you , and there is a ritual that goes with that .
16	I think that 's what disturbs me the most , seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically .
9	It has a real life ring to it .
25	The quite simple soundtrack backs this up well , every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong .
14	I am actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self-destructive .
48	I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters do not really reinforce the message consistently , particularly with Carrère , also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film , not in terms of a successive revelation either .
43	I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish , more by design than execution , such as the famous " vagina eye " , and the sodomy of Lasalle , for me , totally hollow images .
44	At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with , and some things do not seem logical , for example we have been clumsily led to believe different things about Carrère 's child .
24	This does not change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird , a " pure " horror movie .
44	There is no comedic dross or genre segueing , like Cube ( 1997/Natali ) , the obvious movie to compare it to , it 's a total immersion experience , where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters .
30	This last comment I make about it being a " pure " experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point .
21	On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian .
38	He very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him .
16	The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge .
7	This prompts Lasalle to go insane .
13	That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge .
8	It 's something I myself have felt .
21	One final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters ' names .
28	To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older librarian character , simply click on Philippe Laudenbach 's page and you will see he was born in 1936 .
28	I 'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in England , but was in many ways very pleased when I finally saw it .
17	There are a lot of great things to the film , for a start the acting .
26	Its not something I have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work .
26	This and the constantly gripping and interesting script , with a nice sorta Lovecraftian feel to it , give the film a real solid backbone .
19	Add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner .
13	It has my favorite kind of gore too , supernatural and splattery .
23	This is one of the most impressive recent horror movies , far more shocking or out there than anything Hollywood can produce .
34	My only gripe was that I wanted the ending to be darker in tone , but it still works , so on the whole I 'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs .
23	I did not feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless .
40	It is original , although reminded me a little of two other French films , Vidocq and City of Lost Children , mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters .
26	Set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off , this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster .
24	Always interesting , with the perennial ' Black Arts ' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable !
11	Scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing .
36	When Jim 's wife , Muriel ( Myrna Loy ) , wants to renovate the apartment , advertising exec Jim falls in love with ( or falls for ! ) an ad for a house .
32	Once he 's purchased the house , bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of Jim 's ' dream house ' goes wrong .
37	One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy , this is a charming little comedy -- not very taxing , with no real great message , but a great way to spend an hour or two .
33	The laughs are there right from the start , when the alarm clock goes off and Jim tries to shut it off , only to be thwarted at every turn by Muriel .
44	The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros , and that 's just what Grant and Loy give us : polished performances , simple chemistry , and a lot of fun .
17	Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well , never hitting a single wrong note .
38	One of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when Bill gets himself locked in the ' store room ' , and Jim goes to ' save ' him ... only to get everyone trapped inside !
50	Every little problem that pops up for the Blandings renovation project -- including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for ' Wham ' -- seems to bring together everything that * could * go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch . 8/10
45	Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell , the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers , a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s ; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished .
39	Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf 's equally bizarre , bosomy male in Fight Club ( 1999 ) , Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet , one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette .
25	With the coming of the book however , and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents , Marcus assumes greater and greater significance .
19	At first assured of an early bail , meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events .
38	Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell , a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed , closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere .
39	Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price , and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an ' escape ' may not be one a man might imagine .
27	With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette 's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does .
44	There is a genuine , growing , Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages , while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina , or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable .
40	The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate , rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions : a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore .
49	Perhaps this is a particularly European manner , as one recalls a similar , measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven 's The Fourth Man ( 1983 ) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye .
41	Lensed well in 1.85:1 , Malefique benefits from excellent performances and , if for this viewer at least , the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been , the journey to the final shot was worth taking .
8	Well , magic works in mysterious ways .
35	This movie about 4 prisoners , trying to escape with the help of spells , written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense .
27	Even if it had something of a theater-play ( almost everything happens in the cell ) it never got boring and it was acted very well .
41	In the tradition of " Cube " you felt trapped with the Characters and even if they were criminal , you developed some sympathy with some of them , only to change your mind by the twists the story takes .
18	Some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air .
24	Altogether intense and entertaining and as I did not expect anything ( a friend rented it ) , it was a positive surprise !
27	" Maléfique " is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart .
37	Eric Valette may not be a well-know name yet , but with " Maléfique " , his feature length debut , he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like Jeunet , Gans or Aja .
29	The film is the story of four prisoners in a cell , four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal : to get out .
20	Their personalities will clash as Carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic .
31	Written by Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier , " Maléfique " is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of Clive Barker 's stories .
39	The movie 's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters , they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities .
21	The story 's supernatural element is very well-handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a Gothic novel .
41	Despite being a movie about four men locked in a room , the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact , the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust , claustrophobia , and specially , paranoia .
21	Director Eric Valette makes a great use of atmosphere , mood and his cast to give life to the plot .
22	Despite its obvious lack of budget , he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original , fresh and very attractive .
40	His subtle and effective camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location , and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot .
25	The very few displays of special effects are very well-done and Valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore .
19	The characters are what make this film work , and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit .
21	Gérald Laroche is excellent as Carrère , a man at first sight innocent , but who hides a dark past .
18	Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are very effective too , specially Rataud in his very demanding role .
29	However , is Clovis Cornillac who steal the show with his performance as Marcus , a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself .
14	The characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them .
15	The movie is terrific , but it is not without its share of flaws .
12	Of course , the most notorious one is its the low-budget .
30	Some of the CGI-effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make-up and prosthetics used in other scenes , however , it is never too bad for it .
28	Anyways , " Maléfique " is another one of those great horror films coming out from France lately , and one that deserves to have more recognition .
25	Valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest ( albeit complex ) tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities .
10	Personally , this film is a new favorite . 8/10
36	I was not born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily I managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90 's and the rest is history ...... I was hooked .
25	It had a great mix of adventure , and plenty of deadpan humour ( mainly from some terrific one liners from William Gaunt ) .
14	They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine .
48	I have to say , I was always a Richard Barrett fan - I loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you did not cross , and those eyes ........ the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV .
11	I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since .
31	However , Craig Stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too .
41	The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with , including Donald Sutherland , Jeremy Brett , Peter Wyngarde , Burt Kwouk , Anton Rodgers , Kate O'Mara , Jenny Linden , Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely .
42	Notable episodes for me were : " Auto Kill " , " The Interrogation " , " The Fanatics " , " The Mission " and " The Gilded Cage " but I am sure every one has their personal favourites .
2	Enjoy !
23	My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970 's .
5	We absolutely adored it .
31	There was something so exotic and mysterious about it , especially when compared to the usual American re-runs ( Petticoat Junction , Green Acres ... you get the idea ) .
30	It had a similar feel to The Avengers ( not too much of a surprise , since it was also British and in the spy / adventure genre ) .
14	I would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up .
29	I have mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it , so I began to wonder if I 'd imagined its whole existence .
16	But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it .
10	Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans .
17	Well , What can I say , other than these people are Super in every way .
33	I wish that I got given these powers , Imagine me , being knocked off my cycle , somewhere and being knocked out cold , then waking up in a special hospital .
12	Later on , I discover that my body has been enhanced .
5	Just like Richard Barrat .
33	These stories are 50 Minutes of pure action and suspense all the way , You can not fight these 3 people , as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry .
8	Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent .
17	When I was a boy , I had a huge crush on her ! ! ! !
11	Now I can see why , on my DVD set .
17	The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series .
17	I also thought that Trymane was a good boss , firm but he got things done !
31	Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up ' The Baron ' with this , a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted ' The Six Million Dollar Man ' .
19	It was a favourite of mine when I was a youngster , and I enjoy watching it still .
32	Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett , while the luscious Alexandra Bastedo pouted her way through her role as Sharron Macready .
10	The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully gruff Tremayne .
34	By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson , Terry Nation and Brian Clemens , while Spooner 's own ' The Interrogation ' compared favourably with ' The Prisoner ' .
20	I regret that there was never a second series ; the concept had so much life left in it .
12	Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron 's affections ?
11	What if Tremayne had learned of the Champions ' powers ?
13	Did the Champions have any other abilities other than those we saw ?
7	We never found out , alas .
12	I was 10 years old when this show was on TV .
7	By far it was my favorite .
6	The actors were very credible .
16	Alexandra Bastedo was just gorgeous .... I just order the DVD ( 15 episodes ) .
6	They did not have super-powers .
14	They just had superior human skills ( strength , hearing , sight ) .
13	The 3 actors were very good in their rolls , very believable .
9	There was a good story in each episode .
29	At the time , there were no special effects or explosions everywhere , so the script was suppose to be good , and the characters performs were great .
11	There was no fancy stuff , like in other shows .
17	They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show .
13	I highly recommend this TV show to anybody that like good stuff .
13	Manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences .
10	The worst one is the lack of closet space !
23	Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full !
49	Melvin Frank and Norman Panama , a great comedy writing team from that era , saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel , whose hero , Jim Blandings , can not stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel , and two daughters , must share .
12	Jim Blandings , a Madison Ave. executive , has had it !
16	When he sees an ad for Connecticut living , he decides to take a look .
30	Obviously , a first time owner , Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent .
9	This is only the beginning of his problems .
8	Whatever could be wrong , goes wrong .
26	The architect is asked to come out with a plan that does not work for the new house , after the original one is razed .
35	As one problem leads to another , more money is necessary , and whatever was going to be the original cost , ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford .
12	The film is fun because of the three principals in it .
22	Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings .
16	Myrna Loy , was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant .
31	The third character , Bill Cole , an old boyfriend of Myrna , turned lawyer for the Blandings , is suave and debonair , the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him .
24	One of the Blandings girls , Joan , is played by Sharyn Moffett , who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint .
15	The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie , but does not have much to do .
24	The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe , who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better .
21	The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies .
39	The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shelly 's " I will Take You There " is not overt , but clearly has ties to his work ( Shelly has acted in two of Hartley 's films ) .
27	Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative , but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light .
33	Though this film is not ironic on the whole ( thank God ) , the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss .
43	With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies , " I will See You There " is a great indie-film that does not stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion .
11	The film begins with Bill 's life falling to pieces .
30	Not only has he sold his best friend Ray a beautiful country home , but his wife Rose has left him in order to join Ray in the retreat .
44	All washed up , Bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister Lucy ( played by the director Adrienne Shelly ) brings him all kinds of surprises : a self-help book and a " date " for her traumatized brother .
21	The unwilling Bill tries to refuse , but the sudden appearance of Bernice at his door leaves him no choice .
21	No doubt Bernice 's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to " rebound " with her .
19	However , her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date .
21	And Bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him , forcing herself upon him .
23	On the way , she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun ( a Pinkerton Detective , no less ) .
42	An imbroglio of angst , resentment , redemption , passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose ... of course , with a few stops along the way .
5	This movie is wonderful .
10	The writing , directing , acting all are fantastic .
6	Very witty and clever script .
15	Quality performances by actors , Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky .
6	Really original and heart-warmingly unpredicatable .
12	The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production .
49	I too have gone thru very painful personal loss ( Twice ) and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well , Life out of balance , nothing makes sense , well meaning relatives , etc ... It was nice to see Ally again .
11	She is one of my all time favorite movie actors .
9	I laughed and cried as the story unfolded .
5	Great story and cast .
3	Well done !
6	Real cool , smart movie .
11	I loved Sheedy 's colors , especially the purple car .
9	Alice Drummond is Wise And Wonderful as Stella .
13	I liked Sheedy 's reference to how her face had gotten fatter .
7	The roadside dance scene is brilliant .
5	Really liked this one .
15	I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne 's " Waitress " ( 2007 ) .
11	This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie .
13	Adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director , an original and unique artist .
21	She managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency .
19	Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge .
13	Male lead Reg Rodgers , looking like Judd Nelson , is fine .
10	There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen .
28	" I will Take You There " tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date .
23	Unlike most romantic comedies , this little indie is mostly tongue-in-cheek situational comedy featuring Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance .
28	A sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving , stays fresh , and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers .
14	This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail .
32	There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which have not come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one .
38	This is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film .
38	At first , the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves , even if grudgingly , through each other .
25	Rogers ' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and Sheedy 's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them .
31	You will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it 's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread .
26	Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt .
42	For a long time it seemed like all the good Canadian actors had headed south of the border and ( I guessed ) all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies .
45	This film was a real surprise : despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces , the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we , the viewer , got back was almost true suspension of belief .
19	When the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police , you almost believed it was possible .
25	If you are a fan of some of the better sex farces ( Canadian or not ) you should definitely seek this one out .
17	And the big surprise , this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity .
18	At the end of the movie i still do not know whether i liked it or not .
10	So was the case with most of the reviewers .
38	But none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in . long ago i read a quote : THERE ARE 2 KIND OF WRITERS , 1 .
6	THOSE WHO THINK AND WRITE .
3	AND 2 .
24	Aside from a few titles and the new Sherlock Holmes movie , I think I have watched every movie Guy Ritchie has directed .
2	Twice .
19	Needless to say , I am a big fan and Revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why .
24	This movie is a very different approach from Ritchie , when you look at it comparatively with Lock , Stock ... and Snatch .
42	Revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he did not expect and a guided walk for redemption that he did not know he needed .
35	Along with seeing André Benjamin of OutKast fame strut his acting ability , other standout acts are Ray Liotta playing the maniacal Mr. D / Macha and Mark Strong playing Sorter , the hit-man .
40	After being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner , Macha , Jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate Macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent .
42	When he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from Macha , Jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that 's left him with three days to live .
48	Along with having the air of death loom , and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money , Jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him , which introduces Sorter - a hit-man under Macha 's employ .
23	The movie unravels to a humbling process for both Jake and Macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons .
24	The style of the movie is top-notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes .
35	Although a lot of nods at Ritchie 's previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue , the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre .
35	It 's also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should .
38	The characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and , true to Ritchie fashion , they are all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone 's affairs .
35	I could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but I do not want to take too much away from it if you have not seen it yet .
25	It may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it 's a great movie and it should be seen .
43	If you are lucky and you have not seen the watered-down US release , see if you can get the original UK version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take .
25	I saw it with my crew around early-2006 and we are still talking about it with little things we have picked up on today .
29	It has garnered its cult status , and it 's well - deserved as the film where Ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit .
28	Standout Line : " Fear or revere me , but please , think I am special . We share an addiction . We are approval junkies . "
43	If you are a fan of Altman 's large ensemble casts , as evidenced in major films like M.A.S.H. , Nashville , Gosford Park , and lesser seen films like A Wedding , then you will no doubt be entertained by HealtH .
45	Like a lot of Altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film , but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like Nashville or A Wedding , rather it has a more centered feel , perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park .
36	The whole thing is an obvious satire on the Health movement , filled with over-top , outlandish , contradictive characters , with guest stars like Dick Cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing .
34	Underlining the whole election process is Altman 's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having .
15	This would be one of Altman 's last films like this for a while !
49	" Ah Ritchie 's made another gangster film with Statham " thought the average fan , expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock ; expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts , but none too hard for " me and the lads " to swallow after a few beers .
13	Ah , pay attention , you do need to watch this film .
31	No cups of tea , no extra diet cokes from the counter , no " keep it running " shouts as you nip to the fridge - watch the film !
37	No laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence ( and if that floats your boat , so be it ) but sharp solid direction , excellent dialogue , and great performances .
14	My favourite - Big Pussy from The Sopranos , always a reliable hood .
20	I have just finished watching this film and I can honestly say that this is a work of art .
12	I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2 .
41	Not only does Guy bring together a b list ( ish ) movie cast and make them into such glorious characters , he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination .
38	Far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate ... yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable .
5	This film is special .
5	Get it , now !
43	In the classic sense of the four humors ( which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment ) , Altman 's " H.E.A.L.T.H. " treats all of the humors , and actually in very funny , entertaining ways .
47	There is the Phlegm , as personified by Lauren Bacall 's very slow , guarded , and protective character Esther Brill , who 's mission in life appears to be all about appearance , protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being .
40	There is Paul Dooley 's Choleric Dr. Gil Gainey , who like a fish out of water ( perhaps more like a seal ) flops around frenetically , barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness .
24	The Melancholy of Glenda Jackson 's Isabella Garnell smacks of Shakespeare 's troubled and self-righteous Hamlet -- even proffering a soliloquy or two .
27	And let us not forget Henry Gibson 's Bile character , Bobby Hammer ( " The breast that feeds the baby rules the world " ) .
8	This is Altman at his classic best .
16	I am giving ten out of ten it 's one of the best movies ever .
5	THE VERY BEST EVER .
16	Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed .
27	But there are lots of shallow movies in Hollywood nowadays , you can not remember what it was about the next day you had seen it .
35	On the contrary , Revolver is unique , I could have hardly expected it 's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself , of everyone who was to watch it .
21	Absolutely unsurpassed , astounding , dazzling ... One can get insight watching this , I have no doubt about that .
33	Actually , no words can express my admiration ... I am still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood rubbish we had been watching .
12	Thank you from all heart , it 's simply the best .
6	it 's all very simple .
15	I have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life .
17	Believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all-time classic .
36	I was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both Lock , Stock .... and Snatch , but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed .
15	I absolutely loved this film and i can not wait to see it again .
19	This film is totally different to both of the aforementioned Ritchie films , and also a lot better .
28	I have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as Guy Ritchie has just done with this movie .
37	I believe he has taken movie-making to another level ( i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film , but i believe time will prove me right ) .
33	This movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the 2hr or so running time as i could not stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together .
50	I have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film ( some answers from endless hours of thinking , some answers from reading other people 's take on the film ) and now can not wait until Sunday when i will see it again .
26	I just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been .
39	Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist , Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers .
30	But then , nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew , especially one using the gangster / con-artist movie framework .
37	But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck , and he 's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life , the universe and everything .
20	Not worth starting a new religion over , but I am surprised it did not get a US distributor .
14	Maybe they found Ray Liotta 's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary ?
30	Having read the reviews for this film , I understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good .
17	However , this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time .
21	The majority of reviews that i had read , said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow .
30	And whilst some parts do leave you confused , the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you have missed so much .
40	If you have got time , and have time afterwards to think about the film , and even watch it again , you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film .
19	I think it 's fantastic , and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game .
16	I will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone !
16	The fact is it was not what anyone was expecting , especially from Guy Ritchie .
31	What everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners " do ya like dags ? " etc , but this is far more mature than his previous works .
32	I would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder , this film demands all your attention !
38	Look past the cool and dazzling look of the film , try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film .
36	Yes this has its influences from modern classics ( fight club , pulp fiction etc ) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none .
25	First of all , do not go into Revolver expecting another Snatch or Lock Stock , this is a different sort of gangster film .
15	I saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience .
17	It 's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking WHAT was that ?
15	That was awful , and the other half will leave thinking WHAT was that ?
4	That was cool .
14	Personally i like films that i do not understand , i . e .
12	Mullholland Drive , and Usual Suspects , so i enjoyed Revolver .
7	It definitely was not perfect though .
40	I saw the big twist coming a mile away , at least part of it , and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good , Revolver leaves A LOT of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed .
8	However there were many good things too .
33	I thought the acting was superb from all the main actors , Jason stratham , Ray Liotta , Vincent Pastore , and even Andre Benjamin ( who was a pleasant surprise ) .
20	This movie definitely kept my interest , with one great , suspenseful , action packed , scene after another .
18	When Ray Liotta was being held under the table wow .... well you have to see it .
21	The script was extremely well done , and the soundtrack , as with most Guy Ritchie films , was great .
50	Though a step below such movies as , Fight Club , Mullholland Drive , and Usual Suspects , it was still an awesome fast paced , psychological , action movie , with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over .
13	I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away .
22	It is a real masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most of the people think it 's garbage .
19	The main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power !
46	This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way . " The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look " - do you remember this from the movie ?
34	GR expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance .
4	A superb movie !
3	First time .
32	True , it does not compare to other mind-mucks like " The Usual Suspects " or " Memento " , but in its own right its an intelligent and thought-provoking film .
15	Another thing I really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is .
15	Every scene , every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages .
11	If you see it you will know what I mean .
17	So , to conclude ... watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it .
15	If not , well , no-one ever said " Revolver " is for everyone .
7	And that 's my 2 cents .
18	First of all , when people hear ' GUY RITCHIE ' , they immediately think of SNATCH .
20	Yes , Snatch was a good movie , but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie to Snatch .
10	They do not expect him to explore new frontiers .
17	This movie REVOLVER is different than snatch ; it 's much darker and is very complex .
22	The reason I gave a rating of 10 is because I have had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything .
8	So this movie toys with your head .
6	It 's very cleverly written .
7	This movie is different than Snatch .
27	It was done wonderfully , the cinematography is beautiful , and you can recognize Guy Ritchie 's personal touch ( style of directing ) in it .
21	What won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers .
16	The film 's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is .
18	This has been described many times as as making the film " inaccessible " to the viewer .
49	The film 's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle ( or not so subtle ) hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory , IE .
37	Ray Liotta 's character brandishing a gun saying the words " fear me " is portrayed as both tragically pathetic ( from Statham 's POV ) or interrogating and bold ( from Liotta 's POV ) .
14	Take the scene where Jason Statham 's character runs afoul of a car .
45	This throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever ... but Ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death .
16	It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand .
26	And even easier to say " well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film ! " .
35	In my humble opinion , Revolver is a stylish , complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers .
29	Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny , cheeky cockney romps , does not mean he can not be deep without being " pretentious " .
7	Funny people can be thoughtful too .
28	I watched this movie when I was almost quite a kid , and , naturally , was moved to tears by this story of a fox family .
24	The fantastic scenery at Hokkaidô , the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists .
12	I am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack .
20	To German viewers it might be useful to know that the DEFA-dubbing is the only one worth listening to .
17	I taped both ( DEFA and BR ) but I keep viewing the first one only .
16	Glacier Fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made .
31	The film makes you care about each member of this fox family , from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic .
16	Set against an inhospitable countryside , the audience 's hearts warm to the family members .
19	The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms .
30	Man remains one of the biggest predators , but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living , not just surviving beyond human endeavours .
26	I saw The Glacier Fox in the theatre when I was nine years old - I bugged my parents to take me back three times .
31	It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan , narrated by a wise old tree .
8	The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well .
21	It would be a good seller today , better than many of the weak offerings to children 's movies today .
12	I have been looking for this movie for so many years .
13	I saw this move when I was nine and loved this movie .
11	I called Disney all the movie stores and the net .
3	No luck .
10	What a waste it was a very good movie .
6	It will be missed : (
17	I saw this movie when I was little - It was called " Glacier Fox " .
7	I was totally traumatized by it !
9	It follows a cute little fox family around .
15	The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the little foxes .
17	I also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while I was in hysterics .
24	I will not tell you what happened , but let us just say it does not end well for all of the foxes .
16	I was used to Disney type nature films where the animals do not REALLY die .
3	Oh man .
8	This movie made me cry for hours .
35	It was a good movie ... I think - I was really little and truth be told - all I remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die .
13	Rent it if you can , but do not show your kids !
14	I recommend families if possible , to show this to older children only .
16	Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle .
15	Now that thats out of the way , let me explain about this movie .
24	This is in reality a documentary of a male fox , who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate .
14	The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score , is breath taking .
19	You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible , it will get ugly later .
24	They gave both the fox and the vixen names , but I can not remember what they are for the likes of me .
12	He fights off this invading male , to win her love .
23	They later on create a den , and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs ; one of which is blind .
22	There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family , but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon .
21	The first victim is the blind pup , who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away .
22	The second victim is the mother , who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole .
8	She unknowingly walks into a foot trap .
19	While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot , causing her to bleed to death .
16	The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree .
19	The male is now a single dad , forced to take on the roll of mom and dad .
13	He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life .
32	It later proves not to be enough , when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own ; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man .
24	I will not spoil the surprising ending for you , but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail .
19	And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through .
26	I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s , when we had a thing called Showbiz cable .
25	I was only 4 when I saw it , but I could never understand why they would not let me see all of it .
31	Now I know why , after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney , when I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on .
6	I was moved to tears .
14	But as dark and ugly as it was , it serves a purpose .
20	To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals , and why they are endangered .
19	This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species , and I hoped it worked .
23	Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney , they do not teach about why animals are going extinct .
29	The encroachment of land , the killing off of the foxes main prey , and senseless killing of these beautiful animals ; has resulted in them becoming endangered .
24	I wish they would make sequel to this movie , ( Glacier Fox 2005 ) to see if they are being treated better .
16	Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up .
22	This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes , especially when one of the parents suddenly dies .
20	The surviving parent takes on the roll of both , and tries to teach the important lessons of life .
22	It is not always enough to protect them when they are adults , especially when some of their lives becomes ruined .
8	Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves .
12	Best all around soundtrack and musical score I have ever heard .
14	Some of the acknowledged Altman " masterpieces " seem sadder to me now .
5	Maybe it 's me .
33	Like the last reviewer , I even like this " lesser " Altman ( shown recently on FMC ) , although I do not think he was aiming at a wide audience .
11	Organization politics as a " microcosm " for public campaigns .
48	Some of this satirical " docudrama " is now dated , like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show , but I found much of the dialog funny and insightful ( e.g. " You are for real . That means you are no threat to anyone " ) .
13	The story is not " profound , " but I liked it .
16	All in the inimitable Altman style , although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual .
4	But pretty inimitable .
29	The villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing , that is what I guess makes him so mean .
20	I do not think most men will like this movie , especially if they ever cheated on their wife .
17	This is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end .
33	But then , there you have it , a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say , " HOKIE AS HELL . " A pretty good movie until the end .
19	Ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning .
10	And then there is the aftermath of what happened .
13	Guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending .
15	I am left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end .
8	This film made John Glover a star .
17	Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film .
6	And I mean that sport .
31	Successful self-made married businessman Harry Mitchell ( a superbly steely performance by Roy Scheider ) has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper Cini ( the gorgeous Kelly Preston ) .
20	When Harry refuses to pay up , the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did it .
17	This in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between Harry and the hoods .
39	Director John Frankenheimer , adopting a tough script based on Elmore Leonard 's gritty crime thriller novel , expertly maintains a steady snappy pace , delivers plenty of gripping tension , and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere .
40	The leads are all uniformly excellent , with stand-out supporting turns by Ann-Margret as Harry 's bitter neglected wife Barbara , Vanity as brash jaded prostitute Doreen , and Lonny Chapman as Harry 's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle .
10	The tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout .
34	The wickedly profane dialogue , Jost Vacano 's glossy cinematography , Gary Chang 's stirring score , the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well .
14	As an added bonus , both Vanity and Preston take their clothes off .
14	A very strong and satisfying little number that 's well worth checking out .
12	There is always got to be more though has not there ?
26	So Harry let us himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans ( you are only as old as the woman you are feeling ) .
23	As in many films noir , one mistake , in an otherwise blotch-less life , leads to a downwards arc for Harry .
6	Three blackmailers leech onto him .
17	These are where the value are for me , great character actors playing very believable roles .
30	Bobby Shy ( played by Clarence Williams III ) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers .
26	He 's reminiscent of Pluto , the vicious black ex-con psychopath from Carl Franklin 's well-regarded neo-noir " One False Move " ( 1992 ) .
9	There is a similar character motivation I believe .
18	Both men have had enough of the man , and well pretty much everyone , in extremis .
47	Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks , a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour , and $50 for a whole hour ( did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount ? ) .
26	He 's in over his head , and it 's great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat , believable breakdown .
36	John Glover wins as Alan Raimy , who is the brains of the plot , an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui .
28	In common with One False Move , though not exclusively , I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence .
16	So far so good but I think there is a real problem with the film .
18	Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his " tit in the wringer " .
12	My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider .
19	Roy Scheider protagonists never lose , they are self-sure and smooth , but not in an annoying way .
31	I feel I am being asked to believe that his character is in peril , the movie relies on this for dramatic tension ; however I did not believe it .
26	Roy Scheider does not convince as an adulterer either , you do not feel any annoyance with him at all , his character is Teflon-coated .
11	It also felt like a movie that took some cuts .
40	At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped : Harry 's wife , Ann Margaret , is pretty much a cardboard cutout , an extension of Harry , her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention .
15	The effect that the affair has on Harry 's marriage is not properly communicated .
15	This could be a Frankenheimer problem , he 's not known for character development .
22	I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS .
41	There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film , but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better ( no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider ) .
23	The film felt short , even with the long running time , and I think could have taken some more fleshing out .
25	But you really can not forget the sleaze , like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour .
10	52-Pick Up never got the respect it should have .
14	It works on many levels , and has a complicated but followable plot .
10	The actors involved give some of their finest performances .
17	Ann-Margret , Roy Scheider , and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals .
37	Notable too are Vanity , who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows , and Kelly Preston , who 's character will haunt you for a few days .
14	Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this .
9	This is a great " small " film .
26	I say " small " because it does not have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions , as in a John Woo film .
13	Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three " bad guys " .
13	John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days .
41	The film is very easy to watch , the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine -- instead of everything going around and around , it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens .
6	Wonderful ending , very positive .
30	I never read the Elmore Leonard book , but it can not be much different from the film because it FEELS like I am watching an Elmore Leonard movie .
8	This slick and gritty film consistently delivers .
48	It 's one of Frankenheimer 's best and most underrated films and it 's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date ( and if you are scratching your head thinking " but I loved GET SHORTY " you need to be punched in the face ) .
23	In my opinion , no one captures the " feel " for Leonard 's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP .
25	The relocation of the story from Detroit ( novel ) to Hollywood ( film ) elevates the story 's sleaze factor to amazing heights .
13	Be a man , have a few beers and watch this movie .
24	For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are : Swag , Rum Punch , Cat Chaser , City Primeval , and 52 Pick-Up .
11	My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE .
20	I also have a real special place in my cold , movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday .
9	I have always liked this John Frankenheimer film .
20	Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this was not just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer .
24	His taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference , he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant !
15	You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made .
13	I have always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance .
24	Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he 's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out .
36	Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail , murder , sex , drugs , and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts .
19	What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped ?
8	A guilty pleasure to say the least .
17	Vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance .
10	A classic exploitive thriller that should not be forgotten .
14	Based on Elmore Leonard , this is a violent and intelligent action film .
13	The story : a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals .
27	Roy Schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit 's got to go to John Glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath .
45	I must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film . also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are Kelly Preston as the young bate for Schieder 's character .
19	Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers .
20	I am glad to say that Ann-Margaret still has not lost it - this lady is a true babe .
10	Do not look at the rate of this film .
31	I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film .
10	You will enjoy it , that 's a promise .
3	Recommended A+ .
2	Spoilers !
27	From the very moment I saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news , I wanted to see it .
36	I do not remember who it was , or which local Omaha newscast carried the review , but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going Nebraskan .
23	They showed a snippet from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she 's swimming in the pool .
29	Glover 's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth , using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out .
4	I was hooked .
7	There was one problem , though .
24	I was only 13 years old at the time , and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable .
11	Let us just say , it was worth the wait !
15	If ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine , this movie is it .
11	To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement .
23	The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman .
32	Roy Scheider , who is as effective as ever , plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains .
15	John Glover 's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time .
18	He 's sleazy , funny at times , and always on the brink of doing something crazy .
29	Then there is Robert Trebor 's ( nice name , by the way ! ) character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme .
19	He is a whimpering , sweating , coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models .
23	Then , you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy , a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason .
15	Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear ?
37	After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he 's up against , Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation , that is until Glover goes after his wife !
21	The conflict is played out brutally , with virtually the entire cast getting shot , raped , or blown up .
12	I do not know why I love this movie so much .
12	It really should creep me out , but it does not .
25	Maybe it 's because these characters are all interesting , and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try .
29	It 's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover 's running around out in L.A. looking for trouble .
48	Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle . " Hey sport , have a nice day ! " This film has plenty of shootouts , cool cars , great dialog ( like the line in my opening statement ) , and decent acting .
9	Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars .
22	Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover 's place .
17	Another thing I must add : How hot are the women in this film ? ? ?
2	Wow !
8	Travolta did right by marrying Kelly Preston .
2	Yum !
17	We also see Vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again Christian .
3	And Ann-Margret .
21	What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential American Beauty . 9 of 10 stars .
5	So sayeth the Hound .
10	Added Feb 14 , 2008 : RIP Roy Scheider !
17	Having only seen two of his pictures previously , I have come to terms with Altman .
44	Before , though , I always labeled his style of film-making " boring . " You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius . " HealtH " is fairly underrated , and very questionably out of print .
16	In fact , I do not think it 's ever even been issued to VHS .
4	Why is that ?
21	When all of these crappy films get DVD releases daily , this one is left behind for no good reason ?
11	Honestly , I had no real problems with this film .
13	It was , for the most part , consistently amusing and funny .
22	Almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason , be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances .
6	There is real skill here .
16	And Paul Dooley 's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating .
15	If you can , try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem .
21	It 's not perfect , but it 's much better than most of the sludge out there getting DVD releases .
15	Hell , I 'd be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing .
17	It 's often on the Fox Movie Channel , though , so look out for it .
20	Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in The Sopranos . he died by getting shot in the eye .
13	This was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the Sopranos .
6	Brendan Filone is too good .
18	Brendan Filone shall haunt Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior can not take it anymore .
7	Brendan Filone is the best character .
15	Brendan Filone was killed in episode # 3 , Denial , anger , acceptance .
8	But his legacy will live on forever .
9	Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos !
8	Brendan Filone is the best character ever .
33	I recommend this show to anyone who likes Drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing , because it does not get any better than this series .
6	Brendan Filone is the best .
10	Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos .
22	Unfaltering performances , rock-solid writing , and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever .
19	All of the cast are strong , but Falco and Gandolfini earned every inch of those Emmy 's .
18	Anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes ; particularly from the first few seasons .
21	James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce , absolutely terrifying , and you still find yourself loving him - mesmerized by him .
34	Many people that I have spoken to about The Sopranos ( who have not seen it yet ) will say " I am just not a fan of mafia movies / shows " .
2	Whatever .
10	Run - do not walk - and get it .
27	Those same people usually love " E.R. " , but I bet they do not much care for hospitals ... It 's not about the context .
6	This is my favorite show .
7	I think it is utterly brilliant .
11	Thanks to David Chase for bringing this into my life .

21	Tony ( James Gandolphini ) is a great actor and played his character excellent , as well as the others .
27	Each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long .
50	The last episode was good , I am not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony did not die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense .
28	Tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
20	Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly I am appalled .
26	For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i am afraid i do not know what the world has come to .
6	Let me tell u something .
20	I started watching many T. V shows like Lost , Prison Break , Dexter , Deadwood and even Invasion .
40	But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season , especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season .
6	Then we have The Sopranos .
35	I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season , and more importantly all of its episodes .
12	There is no department that this show does not excel in .
7	Acting - Nothing short of superb .
8	The raw emotion he displays is superb .
20	All of these actors perform to the best quality , and all giving an excellent performance in each episode .
19	Then we have the story , never have i been so sucked into a T. V show before .
8	The story is nothing short of excellent .
15	Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic .
21	I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of .
40	Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence , but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television , and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show .
50	Not just say its too violent , or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral , i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day , i do not think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God .
44	I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me , you will be hooked from the very first episode , i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show , hooked on it .
23	" The Godfather " of television , but aside from it 's acclaim and mobster characters , the two are nothing alike .
16	Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks .
34	His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband , and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy .
25	After analysis , Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony 's problems actually derive from his mother Livia , who 's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder .
32	Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character ; yet Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother , respectively .
13	Falco , Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles .
27	Van Zandt ( from the E-Street Band ) plays his first and only role as Tony 's best friend , and is quite convincing and latching .
23	Chianese , the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film , plays Tony 's uncle and on-and-off nemesis .
23	Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore , Ventimiglia , Curatola , Proval , Pantoliano , Lip , Sciorra and Buscemi .
26	Even as the show continues for over six season , it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment . **** ( out of four )
33	As the Godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite , this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man 's point of view .
16	If you have never watched this show , you are in for an extended treat .
44	Even Carmella , his wife , when given a chance for a way out , finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own .
13	If you followed the whole thing , you know how it ends .
18	If you did not , trust me you have never seen a TV show end like this .
38	Though " The Sopranos " is yet another gift from the megahit " The Godfather " and sequels , which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia , " The Sopranos " takes another tack .
18	Colorful characters dominate this series , which does not hold back on the sex and graphic violence .
40	Tony Soprano ( James Gandolfini ) is a mob head with a wife and two children , living in New Jersey , who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his biological family with his mafia one .
36	To get to the bottom of his attacks , he sees a psychiatrist , Jennifer Melfi ( Lorraine Bracco ) , who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time .
33	Tony 's henchman - Paulie , his nephew Christopher , his Uncle Junior ( the titular head of the mob ) , his good friend Pussy - are all fully fleshed-out characters .
48	As we learn going through the series , there are enemies not only from without , but from within , and one of those enemies includes Tony 's sickly but horrible mother ( Nancy Marchand ) , who convinces Junior that Tony is a danger to him .
24	Tony 's sister Janice , meanwhile , is searching for money in her mother 's house with a stethoscope and a Geiger counter .
34	As far as Tony 's mistress problems , his psychiatrist points out that Tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough , and asks him if it sounds familiar .
8	Yeah , it sounds like his mother .
28	I am of Italian descent , and yes , I am sick of Italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all Italians are mobsters .
35	The only un-Italian thing about Tony is that he does not have a finished basement , something unheard of in the rest of my family ( except my parents never had one either ) .
31	The standouts in this show are Gandolfini , as a ruthless gangster on antidepressants , Falco , who is brilliant as his wife , and Bracco as the tortured Jennifer .
5	But everyone is excellent .
25	If you can take the violence and the language , this is a great show , an unrelenting portrait of New Jersey mob life .
28	The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever , so naturally my expectations were through the roof , and yet the show surpassed them .
42	David Chase 's epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more , and cements HBO as the closest TV can get to cinematic perfection , paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away .
36	Realism is present when it is needed , but Chase 's decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for " dream episodes " and the like only adds more layers to the series .
45	Chase -- along with a strong writing staff including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter , future creators of Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire respectively -- turns New Jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters I have seen on TV .
18	James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony , one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever .
15	Edie Falco matches the power of Gandolfini 's performance as Tony 's wife Carmela .
20	Scenes between Tony and Carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television .
27	The supporting cast is almost as phenomenal , and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons , somehow without any redundancies .
23	Nancy Marchand steals the show as Tony 's overbearing mother Livia , an insight into Tony 's personality problems and panic attacks .
19	The familiarity of Marchand 's incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far .
27	Michael Imperioli is Christopher , Tony 's protégé , whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed .
34	Drea De Matteo plays Christopher 's girlfriend Adriana , and is so well - meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with Christopher 's career .
42	Tony Sirico is Paulie , introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic , but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show , and nobody plays true anger better than he .
10	And that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
28	There are 50 + great characters with powerful arcs , and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show .
40	Comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series , which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough , the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered .
44	The Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I have seen overall , and its highs are so mindblowing that I would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows ( most of which I disagree with ) .
28	Whether you love or hate the ending , or what you make of it is irrelevant : the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself .
16	The iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history .
33	There are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show , so if you are thinking of watching something else instead , do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit .
18	The Sopranos ( now preparing to end ) is the very peak of adult television and drama .
13	When The Sopranos hits the mark , it really hits the mark .
29	Using great writing and great actors ( most of them being extras from Goodfellas ) the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way .
27	Heading up the cast is James Gandolfini , who for all intensive purposes is Tony Soprano , and Edie Falco , who certainly holds her own .
26	The series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary ( usually violence and foul language ) .
20	Tony Sirico , Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting .
38	Seasonal extras are also worth note including names like Steve Buscemi ( great ! ) , Joe Pantoliano ( great ! ) , David Proval ( good ) , Robert Patrick , Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent .
29	The Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique TV .
35	Symbolism and simple story lines , dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect HBO package .
3	Watch it ...
9	Well ... easily my favourite TV series ever .
33	Call me a walking mail cliché but include violence , mafia , sex , gambling , drugs etc . on a show and you are already winning points on in my book .
50	Above all stand two actors , James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano , and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini , he fits his roll in a way that words can not express , if you have not seen him as tony yet see it now !
26	The Sopranos stands out as an airtight , dynamic exploration of American life , and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money .
33	By setting the story in the milieu of the underworld , David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt , low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era .
9	Every character represents a facet of American industry .
26	Tony Soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff , torn between familial duty and a need to keep his " business " on an even keel .
16	The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward .
31	The characters of Christopher , Paulie , and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise , who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit .
34	With the character of Ralph , Joe Pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath , a twisted businessman who 's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power .
30	And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old-guard , which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up - and-comers to deflect blame .
18	Though abrasive and occasionally disturbing , The Sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate TV drama .
27	PS A good companion piece to Chase 's series would be The Shield , another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting .
18	I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes .
16	But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump , You would like this movie .
25	You can not compare the quality of the filming to those of course , but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose .
11	Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite .
4	Just my opinion .
16	I am sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French .
10	So this film is not for a world audience .
16	And while I am not a trained film critic , I know what I like .
10	I could not stop laughing through the whole movie .
14	My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .
37	I can not add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting , balanced writing , multi-faceted characters , a great anti-hero in Tony , great commentary on millennial American life .
17	The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony 's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous .
36	Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh 's interesting history as an outsider muscling in , Ralphie 's total irredeemable viciousness , Chris ' dual desires in life , and so on .
23	I have to dig into some of the criticisms however , especially the ' it glorifies violence / belittles Italian-Americans ' one .
14	Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American , would they attack themselves ?
26	There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef , Dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos .
23	Most of the characters do not really choose the life they have ; family background or circumstances largely corner them into it .
29	Outsiders ( even of Italian stock ) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2 , for example .
28	If you criticise this show , I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist , or Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual ?
31	Presumably you will not listen to rap music that discusses gangs , or r'n'b which discusses promiscuity , or rock music which discusses drugs ( or any other combination ) ?
18	People are not as stupid as some of you make out .... Not everything is perfect however .
16	Before Dogma 95 : when Lars used movies as art , not just a story .
8	A beautiful painting about love and death .
11	This is one of my favorite movies of all time .
9	The color ... The music ... Just perfect .
17	This is not " so bad that it is good , " it is purely good !
49	For those who do not understand why , you have the intellect of a four year old ( in response to a certain comment ... ) Anyways , Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself , a parody of you , and a parody of me .
11	It is the single most genius text in cinematic history .
18	I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa .
16	It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard .
25	I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me , the likes of which we have never seen .
27	It can only be taken in portions ... its sort of exploitive ... by now I am just trying to take up the ten line minimum .
7	My comment ended a while ago .
9	Hopefully it works when I submit it now .
16	The Sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch .
28	It 's smart , it 's quirky , it 's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can not resist watching .
26	The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters , set in the subterranean world of the New York crime families .
27	For most of the time , you really do not know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back , or buy them lunch .
40	Further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - These are dangerous men , most of them murderers , but by God if you do not love them too .
29	I have laughed at their wisecracks , been torn when they have made err in judgement , and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal .
45	The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this show 's subtext - people are not always as they seem , and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds .
11	If you have not already , you most definitely should .
39	Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS , mix it with THE GODFATHER , add some Roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy , and you have THE SOPRANOS , about a mob clan operating out of northern New Jersey .
9	It 's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling .
31	I am not the biggest fan of this show , but I do admire James Gandolfini 's very complicated Tony Soprano , a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience .
44	I also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel-voiced Dom Chianese as the bewildered but murderous Uncle Junior , silver-haired Tony Sirico as the perpetually perplexed Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the duplicitous , tough-as-nails Carmela Soprano .
27	The violence is sudden and graphic , the body count steadily climbs each season , but it is often the small moments that matter most here .
43	Watch Paulie and Tony 's nephew Christopher ( Michael Imperioli late of LAW & ORDER ) as they get lost in the Pine Barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck , both convinced they have had it .
24	I have only watched the first series on DVD , but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script .
37	The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino , and almost as good as The Godfather ( hence not a " 10 " ) , and far better than any of Guy Ritchie 's efforts .
19	Although there is plenty of action , some of it pretty bloody , the story is character driven .
18	It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce . 2 .
5	The music . 3 .
12	It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems .
50	It probably is not fair that I have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten , but oh well ....... From a standpoint of acting , how could any actor fail with these characters ?
11	Each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life .
31	Tony Soprano-while a mob " Capo " and suffering from mental illness , still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive .
20	Each of his men , you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism .
23	It definitely brings out a sort " nosey " side in each and every viewer , and I include myself in this !
27	While some above do not care for Bracco , I have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since Good Fellas .
41	She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason , that makes him decent , that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long , if ever .
27	She is simply put , his savior . ( Not speaking in religious tones ) But the knockout performance here is without doubt , Edie Falco .
32	To see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed HBO series , " Oz " and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress .
21	She has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress , something only actresses like Merle Streep can get away with .
9	A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles .
21	But as I have mentioned before , with a characters a strong as these , how can any actor fail ?
13	Livia 's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself .
16	She is a survivor , as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors .
31	She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband 's business , yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey .
14	She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself .
28	All in all , the biggest crime from the Soprano Family is that we the viewer have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season .
13	This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series .
30	It was what brought The Larry Sanders Show , Sex and the City , Dream On , and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them .
10	Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic .
19	Until then , I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled .
35	I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it . i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released .
21	In all 42 episodes so far , the best one is definitely episode #3 , Denial , Anger , Acceptance .
15	This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos .
6	His name was Brendan Filone .
15	He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver .
21	Brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang .
32	In the end , he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath , and that 's my most favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos .
8	Brendan Filone is # 1 for me .
22	And my # 2 most favorite character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua , who was killed after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti .
15	Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him .
18	My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte , who was killed right after shooting Christopher .
20	And finally , my # 4 most favorite character is Chucky Signore , one of Uncle Junior 's henchmen .
9	He was killed on a boat by Tony .
7	All the awesome characters are dead .
10	That 's the only bad thing about the Sopranos .
8	All the cool guys always get killed .
12	You know what would be great to change about the Sopranos ?
43	They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris , Tony , Uncle Junior , Silvio , and Paulie , because they need to get their revenge .
15	Brendan Filone shall strike back ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 1
33	" The Godfather " , " Citizen Kane " , " Star Wars " , " Goodfellas " None of the above compare to the complex brilliance of " The Sopranos " .
18	Each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity , completely and utterly three dimensional .
24	We care about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly , despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs. evil , he is evil .
19	Soprano is the most provocative , intricate , and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history .
31	If you are in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer , and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment , watch " The Sopranos " .
25	I defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1 , and not want to continue with the series .
10	Each season is completely brilliant in its own way .
11	DVDs are essential to anybody 's collection **** of out 4
23	I would not go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino , or at least , not just yet .
18	He , however , does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano .
39	In the years since 1999 , Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor ( mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos ) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business .
43	And it 's not just him . " The Sopranos " fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Dominic Chianese , and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony 's dreadful mother .
19	At this point in the show 's existence , it 's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so .
7	The first two seasons were extraordinary .
18	Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner , but without a doubt , extraordinarily done .
21	The third season was great , but did not quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 .
27	Season 4 , which wrapped up right before new-years , was the weakest season yet ( or at least , in my opinion it was ) .
46	Despite a dry-spell , I still found it ( season 4 of " The Sopranos " ) to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that 's saying a lot because lately I have been noticing a trend in good new television shows .
36	Examples of this : Six Feet Under , The Shield , Curb Your Enthusiasm , and OZ ( which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year ) .
19	To close , I 'd like to say , " The Sopranos " is the real deal folks .
42	For the average mature viewer ( 17 and above ) who enjoys drama and does not mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity , you might want to check out " The Sopranos " if you get the chance .
12	Trust me in that it will be well worth the time .
19	The " gangster " genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody .
38	In retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in it 's genre , thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it .
27	The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it 's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance , humor and unvarnished violence .
43	The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew , however , Tony is of two persona 's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent .
22	With out any inhibitions or contradictions I still adamantly believe that The Sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory .
18	All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series , but I will not .
36	If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital , ambiguous , unrelenting , epic , uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you .
27	There are so many reasons as to why I rate the sopranos so highly , one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building .
9	Each character unfolds more and more each series .
19	Also each series has an array of different ' small time characters ' as well as the main .
30	A good example of a character ( who was only in three episodes ) who you can feel for is David the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by Robert Patrick .
9	Every little detail builds the perfect TV series .
28	The show revolves round mob boss Tony Soprano ( James Gandolfini ) who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two .
24	The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable .
30	Whilst Tony runs things with capos Paulie ( Tony Sirico ) and Silvio ( Steve Van Zant ) his nephew Christopher ( Michael imperioli ) looks for a promotion .
24	Every episode also features Tony 's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano ( Edie Falco ) .
32	On top of these problems is his uncle Junior soprano ( Dominic Chianese ) is trying to get what he can out of Tony 's businesses despite being under house arrest .
28	All the acting is powerful and characters complex , but the two who stand out the most are ; James Gandolfini who ' is ' Tony Soprano .
17	Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher , representing the younger ( 20-30 ) generation in crime .
26	If David Chase had not created this masterpiece modern TV dramas of such caliber may not have existed , such as The Wire and Dexter .
14	So the Sopranos is definitely the Godfather , Goodfellas and Pulp fiction of TV
2	Wow .
19	I LOVED the whole series , and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly .
20	Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5 , while remaining better than anything else on television .
18	Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony .
5	The best TV ever .
25	Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the " jack-off fantasies " AJ derides ( and then into which he promptly subsides ) .
10	A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase .
19	As a guy who has seen all the seasons , I can say that JG constantly surprises me .
32	But after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life , I mean I could almost feel the pain he " made " us believe he was going through .
22	I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought at Robert De Niro , Marlon Brando and Al Pacino .
13	These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more .
33	But nowadays they are either old or dead ( Brando ) and it 's OK that they make less movies and their performances are " lighter " than they used to be .
18	I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role .
16	Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance ?
19	When we started watching this series on cable , I had no idea how addictive it would be .
37	Even when you hate a character , you hold back because they are so beautifully developed , you can almost understand why they react to frustration , fear , greed or temptation the way they do .
16	It 's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher 's learning curves .
42	I can not understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher 's abuse of her , verbally , physically and emotionally , but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior .
32	Carmella has a dream house , endless supply of expensive things , but I am sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not .
6	That 's why I watch .
23	It does not matter how many times you watch an episode , you can find something you missed the first five times .
44	We even watch episodes out of sequence ( watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language , A & E with language censored , reruns on the Movie Network ) - whenever they are on , we are there .
7	We have been totally spoiled now .
21	I also love the Malaprop 's . " An albacore around my neck " is my favorite of Johnny Boy .
20	When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary , it is a sign that I should get a life .
24	I will when the series ends , and I have collected all the DVD 's , and put the collection in my will .
39	Greetings from this Portuguese guy : ) I believe The Sopranos are one of the best production ever , it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way , that it 's hard to see the difference .
8	It has the same quality as GodFather !
10	James Gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove !
11	I would love The Sopranos would never finish at all .
4	It 's perfect !
16	In my opinion Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best-ever series made for television .
12	The argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect .
6	Congratulations for such a work .
5	Sorry about my English .
4	Thanks for reading .
30	THE SOPRANOS ( 1999-2007 ) Number 1 - Television Show of all Time Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that would not go past a pilot episode .
21	The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time .
19	James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss , Tony Soprano , accompanied by a stellar cast .
29	Edie Falco is superb as the worrying , loving upper-middle class mother ; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious , greying consiglieri who is often very funny .
34	While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi , and to an extent this is undeniable , I can see so many positives from the show .
25	The portrayal of strong family values , friendships , love and compassion ; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters ?
2	Yes .
21	Furthermore , other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism , social inequality and injustice , homosexuality , drugs etc .
13	This is no shallow , dull show about tough guys and violence .
6	It has so much more .
13	Many of the issues we see on the show are very real .
33	The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters ' lives , which makes the whole thing more interesting .
29	Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini , for envisioning , television 's most complex and enigmatic character .
4	Simply exceptional . 10/10
25	What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude ? " The Sopranos " has literally redefined television as we know it .
14	It has broken all rules , and set new standards for television excellence .
20	Everything is flawless , the writing , directing , and for me , most of all , the acting .
15	Watching this show you will find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real .
17	The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano , or any character .
7	This show is also very versatile .
43	Some people do not watch the show because it 's violent , it 's not all about the violence , it 's about business , family , and many deeper things that all depend on what you , as a fan see .
20	For me , I do not like when people refer to the show , a show about the Mafia .
10	For me , it 's a show about family .
15	A family who , through generations , happen to be apart of the mob .
9	Overall this is a masterpiece of a show .
7	This is what television should be .
3	Right here .
25	Complex characters from stunning acting , magnificent story lines from brilliant writing , and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together ?
12	A show that defines excellence , and dares to be different .
12	The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history .
20	Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence , sublime writing or first rate performances .
18	Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality .
17	Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano , a man who lives in two families .
28	One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group , of which he is the boss of both .
24	Played by James Gandolfini , of True Romance and The Mexican fame , Tony is a fascinating , scary but also likable guy .
23	Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man .
15	Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony .
28	The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever .
23	The true genius of this tale however , is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series .
22	Twenty minute long dream sequences , powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence .
19	Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love , honour and respect for family .
9	The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous .
23	With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America 's most original and compelling drama .
4	Forget Family Redifined .
5	This is Television Redifined .
19	I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine .
36	What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969 , it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course , at that time X meant Maturity .
31	Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie 's release , it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then .
41	It is worth noting that in the 1970 's , MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R , some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today 's standards .
25	I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie .
31	Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women .
19	He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women .
30	After being rejected by all the women he has come across , he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico " Ratso " Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman .
17	Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager .
12	Once again , Joe is conned and before long is homeless .
16	However , Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment .
39	Without giving away much more of the plot , I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams .
22	I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health .
11	I want to make some comments about the movie itself .
13	First of all , the acting is excellent , especially the leads .
20	Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end , there are some classic scenes .
22	In fact , there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny , I find them amusing .
28	For example , there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over .
50	Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says " Hey , I am walkin ' here ! I am walkin ' here ! " I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry .
27	Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman ) sends Joe ( Jon Voight ) to a guy named O'Daniel .
40	What is amusing is that at first , we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut .
24	I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late ' 60 's , much of it rings true today .
42	That 's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years , homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago .
32	Also , many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character .
49	One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight 's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie , he had matured a great deal and that Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman 's character ) was a good influence on him .
36	In conclusion , I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie , one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on .
24	For example , there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings .
45	Also , what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck ( Jon Voight 's character ) and the people who were in his life in Texas .
26	Even the ending , while I do not want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie , is rather open-ended .
10	First I would like to say how great this .
7	It is astounding and sometimes shocking .
32	And to say the least I am 11 years old and this is my favorite movie , I can definitely stand a boring film , but this is anything but boring .
8	It is like a trip through humanity .
9	Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece .
22	It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers ( VOIGHT AND Hoffman ) who build a mutual friendship .
21	Joe Buck ( VOIGHT ) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women .
24	Soon he meets Rico ' RATSO ' Rizzo ( HOFFMAN ) , who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent .
23	Ratso becomes Joe 's ' manager ' but soon both men can not find Joe a job which results in stealing food .
18	As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is .
16	They can not get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party .
18	Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso 's dream spot , Florida .
17	The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film .
15	From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life .
12	This is a great example of a good , dumb movie .
11	No , it is not high art by any means .
14	Nor is the script anywhere close to a Woody Allen or Mel Brooks .
4	BUT SO WHAT !
34	The Killer Tomatoes series ( four movies and a cartoon series ) are basically good-natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the Zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks .
22	As the title suggests , this fourth installment of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy deals with the Killer Tomatoes plot against France .
36	In this case , Professor Gangrene ( John Astin 's 3rd time in the role ) has a plan to rule France through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful King of France .
32	Steve Lundquist returns as Igor , a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true King of France .
18	Obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t K of F , happily skewering the French language .
34	Opposing them is the fearless Fuzzy Tomato ( like the others , FT was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon ) and his human allies .
44	Mark Price , recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the FAMILY TIES series , plays a thinly disguised version of himself , passing himself as " Michael J Fox " as a way to win the girl of his dreams .
19	And Angela Visser is a dream as Marie , gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis .
14	Oh that the former Miss Netherlands had had more of a film career !
33	Another returning member of the Killer Tomatoes stock company is Rick Rockwell ( now best known as the hapless title subject of " Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire ? " ) .
20	Like co-creator John De Bello , Rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series .
9	What can you say about Jon De Bello ?
30	Not much , really , except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and , having done that , has apparently dropped into obscurity .
16	John , if you ever see this , thanks for giving us the Killer Tomatoes .
15	The script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie .
23	Like RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES , the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew .
24	And Mark Price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar Michael J Fox .
20	This is the biggest budgeted of all the Killer Tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series .
29	Okay , the show then moved to Fox Kids as a cartoon series ( which was also quite clever ) , but cartoons just are not the same .
34	I did not at all think of it this way , but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title " Midnight Cowboy " was a gay porno .
43	At that point , all I had known of it was the reference made to it in that " Seinfeld " episode with Jerry trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer 's all sick and with a nosebleed .
28	The movie was great , and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies I can not even remember because they are all crap .
27	Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo , called " Ratso " by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time .
45	You think of him as a scoundrel , but a lovable one ( like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian ) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends , and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such .
23	It 's not the first time they have worked together in lead roles , but the chemistry is so thick and intense .
20	Then there is the sad part that I believe is quite an overstatement to call it " depressing " .
37	Ratso Rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie , can barely walk , barely eat , coughs a lot , is sick , and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to Florida .
19	He 's hurting badly , and only miles away from Miami , he finally dies on the bus .
14	The bus driver reassures everyone that nothing 's wrong , and continues on .
33	Sad , but not in the kind of way that 'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you have just lost your dog of 13 years .
7	All in all , great movie .
23	And the soundtrack pretty much consists just of " Everybody 's Talking ' " played all throughout the movie at appropriate times .
25	An odd move , but a great one , as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly .
11	Go see it , it 's great , go buy it
33	Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy , but Hoffman 's performance , though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman , is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies .
44	As a portrayal of a New York character , only Daniel Day Lewis ' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable , and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso .
23	It 's typical of Hoffman 's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight .
39	I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels .
47	Voight 's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether , except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down , but also teaches him , a lot about how to survive and , more importantly , how to live .
16	Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself .
36	I can not help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute , from a few years later , which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape .
17	Sandra Bernhard is quite a character , and certainly one of the funniest women on earth .
40	She began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s , but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese 's underrated masterpiece , " The King of Comedy " .
10	Her film career never quite took off , though .
25	It 's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar  and Madonna 's best friend for about four years .
41	In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes , Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross , talks about her childhood , Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach , Prince , or Sylvester .
19	Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that 's both sexy and uniquely funny .
37	If you are a Bernhard fan , you can not miss out this film ; it 's a tribute as well to her ( weird ) beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne .
37	And it has influenced filmmakers in their work  " Hedwig and the Angry Inch " , for instance , would look a lot different if " Without You I am Nothing " did not exist .
30	I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969 .
13	After actually seeing it , however , I am not surprised anymore .
27	It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style , cinematography , and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck 's character .
20	The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck 's character in such a short movie .
10	I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked .
24	The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him .
31	I think when he looks in the mirror he 's trying to see if it 's really him that has done - or is about to do - something terrible .
14	I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role .
10	Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate .
11	Anyway , this considered an all-time great for a reason .
8	Jon Voight plays a man named Joe .
9	Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood .
15	He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism .
18	He quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people .
17	He meets a misfit named Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman ) and the two for a relationship .
12	They go out and work together in helping each other out .
4	They become thieves .
14	The two grow remarkably close and soon can not live without each other .
28	However , there is something very important that Ratso has not told Joe , and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together .
10	This is one of the greatest films ever made .
21	It is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other .
16	Their story is devastating to watch , but is ultimately important for people to see .
25	It 's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street .
11	The difference is that this film is from their perspective .
34	Their lives are shown to us and it 's devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt , especially if we at one time were one of those people .
12	However , the film does not try to guilt trip you .
14	Instead , it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling .
22	It is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many Hollywood films portray it such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN .
35	The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty , gritty , and ugly life and it 's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of Joe in this film does .
26	What startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969 , and it has stood the test of time perfectly .
31	Today 's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969 .
31	The film was rated X , but what I notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest , realistic , and effective way .
32	Anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous , awkward , and scary as hell it can be and this film does not shy away from any of that .
18	The sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be .
45	Movies that were X rated such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY , A CLOCKWORK ORANGE , GREETINGS , LAST TANGO IN Paris , and FRITZ THE CAT all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an R rating today .
17	The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem quite strong but they certainly are not sexy .
25	They are not graphic , but they are realistic , and that 's what people should keep in mind when they view this film .
24	The course language that is used in the film , particularly the word " fag " is used effectively and is not gratuitous .
26	The violence is very shocking to watch even today , but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler .
28	I am really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969 , if not more .
35	I can not recommend this classic enough and I do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten .
16	PROS : - Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch .
18	They have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual .
17	Although I love this movie , I can barely watch it , it is so real .
15	So , I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers .
35	I remembered it vividly , but just wanted to see if I could find something I had not seen before ........ I did not : that 's because it 's so real to me .
17	Another " user " wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary .
6	I am all for that !
28	It 's absolutely obvious that most of these people who have made comments about " Midnight Cowboy " may not have been born when it was released .
19	They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in , at a later time .
12	I will be just as ruinously frank : I am 82-years-old .
50	If you are familiar with some of my other comments , you will be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years , and also have appeared in film - you 'd never recognize me , even if you were familiar with my night-club persona .
14	Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ?
16	YOU BET I DO ! ! .... .... and am not the least bit ashamed .
31	If you have not run-into some of them , it 's your loss - but , there is a huge chance you have , but just did not know it .
13	So many moms , dads , sons and daughters could surprise you .
20	It should be no secret MANY actors / actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of " Midnight Cowboy " .
5	Who is to judge ?
32	I can name several , current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities , and were not the least bit damaged by their time spent there .
46	I make no judgment , because these are humans , just as we all are - love , courage , kindness , compassion , intelligence , humility : you name the attributes , they are all there , no matter what the package looks like .
47	The " trivia " about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of " Ratzo " is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input ?
20	I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money .
38	Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit , I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street , looking to make a pick-up .
22	This should be no surprise today , although it 's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities , large and small .
6	Wake-up and smell the roses .
13	They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue .
18	Some of the " users " thought " Joe Buck " had been molested by his grandma .
20	Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend , I did not find any incidence of that .
30	Believe-it-or-not , kids have not ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom .
3	Whose business ?
42	Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets , but some of the " users " point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of " Midnight Cowboy " - his actual salary would surprise you .
6	I think he was robbed !
28	No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role , nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as " Deliverance " .
28	He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it : few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie .
25	The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open , but society has always been hip .
26	I also did not find any homosexuality between " Ratzo " and " Joe " - they were clearly opposites , unappealing to one another .
11	They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship .
32	If you did not understand that at the end of the movie , then you have wasted your time . " Joe 's " bewilderment , but unashamed devotion was apparent .
27	Yes , Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off , and he was as handsome in his youth .
8	Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks .
5	He gave them superbly .
5	Wayne got his Oscar .
46	Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you do not think they are still around , you are mistaken . " The party " ? - attend some of the " raves " younger people attend ..... if you can get in .
21	Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you will see every outrageous personality .
21	Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society 's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times .
38	If you were shocked by her brilliant acting , thinking " this is not real " , look at today 's " ladies " who live on the brink of disrepute .... and are admired for it .
21	The brutality " Joe " displayed in robbing the old guy , unfortunately , is also a part of life .
44	You do not have to condone it , but it 's not too much different than any violence . " Joe " pointedly named his purpose - in that situation , I 'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it .
20	That 's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through , one which I do not watch .
31	I get heartbroken for both ..... John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener - Waldo Salt did not write from clairvoyance .
29	Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history , and should be proud for the honesty of it .
28	Perhaps " only in America " can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations , while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public .
17	Not looking does not mean it is not there - give me the truth every time .
5	Bravo ! to all ......
29	Acidic , unremitting , and beautiful , John Schlesinger 's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago , when American life was even more disorienting .
47	While this film ( from the novel by James Leo Herlihy ) has much to say about the erosion of American life , it transcends ' 60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras .
27	The two main characters , in fact , are standard antiheroes - men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world .
24	The initial focus of ' Midnight Cowboy ' is on 28-year-old Joe Buck , a physically imposing Texas native played by Jon Voight .
42	In the opening scenes , we follow Joe 's bus trip to New York City , where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents - the ability to pleasure women - and earn his fortune as a hustler .
15	We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade .
48	Garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as ' one hell of a stud , ' the young Texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with Enrico ' Ratso ' Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) , a sickly con man and petty thief from the Bronx .
21	Ratso , who is short , thin , and with a limp , proves of little monetary help to Joe .
37	They quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months , Joe and Ratso shiver in a condemned Manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names .
25	It is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them , the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds .
37	Very much of its time , ' Midnight Cowboy ' strings together a wild array of flashbacks , dream sequences , and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds .
20	For every moment of understanding we gain from Joe and Ratso , more questions about their lives are generated .
33	Both men are no doubt in tatters ; they have no clear sense of direction until Ratso falls into the throes of illness and Joe finally senses a purpose for being alive .
21	This revelation pushes ' Midnight Cowboy ' to its conclusion , a rather hopeful one in a very grim story .
35	While Joe and Ratso badly need some luck , the direction of John Schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of Waldo Salt 's screenplay in allowing Voight and Hoffman to thrive .
36	Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast , which features Sylvia Miles , Brenda Vaccaro , and members of the Andy Warhol clique , offers itself as an essential part of the storyline .
24	The flashback sequences involving Voight , Ruth White , and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost .
47	Any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film , thanks to the excellent cinematography of Adam Holender ( ' The Boy Who Could Fly , ' ' Smoke ' ) and editing by Hugh Robertson ( ' Shaft ' ) .
32	The visuals of ' Midnight Cowboy ' work with its soundtrack ( assembled by John Barry ) as a cohesive unit , sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades .
24	The lead song Everybody 's Talking is sung by Nilsson , which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase .
38	The memorable harmonica theme is played by Jean ' Toots ' Thielemans . ' Midnight Cowboy ' has been released in a two-disc collector 's edition by MGM / UA , which contains expanded features and commentary .
18	Both DVD editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film , showing its original brilliance .
30	What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which Joe Buck becomes bonded to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both .
43	There really are not many glimpses of hope in this film for either character , but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other .
16	This film features Jon Voight 's finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffman 's as well .
37	The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns , though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors , including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film .
20	Also , for those interested , Andy Warhol 's apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene .
12	If you have not seen this movie , it is essential .
4	Check it out .
31	" Midnight Cowboy " is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America .
10	Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial .
11	No wonder it was a huge success when initially released .
15	But be warned , its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made .
11	The characters are memorable , well-developed , and ultimately tragic .
22	The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending , something which was basically mandatory by the 80s .
17	Still , this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film .
26	Its a time when well-made , innovative , and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer .
14	All this was over by the time " Star Wars " was released .
10	The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work .
10	It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing .
18	Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects , " Midnight Cowboy " has aged quite well .
12	Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released .
10	The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece .
17	The characters ' backgrounds are never fully explained , but the performances make them completely developed .
19	Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic ( despite their sometimes reprehensible actions ) .
44	Plus , being a fan of vintage exploitation films , I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street . " Midnight Cowboy " is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made . ( 10/10 )
18	Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 , drawing an X rating .
16	By today 's standards , it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating .
35	Jon Voight , who has been better , is competent in his role as Joe Buck , an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City .
20	He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo , who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes .
13	The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic .
8	As Ratso , Dustin Hoffman simply shines .
15	Hoffman has often been brilliant , but never more so than in this portrayal .
14	He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison .
26	Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences .
29	Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production , but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer .
8	Worth seeing for Hoffman 's performance alone .
7	Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody .
12	It 's raw , painful , and realistic but very entertaining .
21	The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who would go on to become Oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances .
24	Voight as the Texas hustler , Joe Buck , who migrates from small town Texas to New York City to become a hustler .
15	He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy .
27	The New York City women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles are different than Texas women .
14	Sadly , Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas .
24	He was raised by his grandmother , Sally Buck , played by the wonderful actress Ruth White who died in 1969 from cancer .
32	The locations in New York City are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck 's characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship .
23	The men are struggling to survive the New York City life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job .
20	As the film evolves , Buck 's past comes to the surface and it 's haunting but not clear .
23	The film is not for children but compared to today 's films and television programming , Midnight Cowboy might be more tame .
17	I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can not forget .
16	It 's also a tearjerker of a film , so get your hankies out too .
43	Hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler ( JON VOIGT ) and his lame con-man sidekick ( DUSTIN Hoffman ) , soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills .
29	A daring film for its time , and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the ' 60s .
26	Symbolic of the " end of innocence " in American films , since it was the only X-rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar .
46	JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body , but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk .
12	But even in this final quest , the two are losers .
34	John Schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by Waldo Salt , and John Barry 's haunting " Midnight Cowboy " theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation .
25	Summing up : A true American classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life .
28	John Schlesinger 's ' Midnight Cowboy ' is perhaps most notable for being the only X-rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture .
29	This was certainly how I first came to hear of it , and , to be completely honest , I did not really expect much of the film .
30	This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible , but somehow I did not consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching .
35	Young Joe Buck ( then-newcomer Jon Voight ) , dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy , travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler , a male prostitute .
34	Women , however , do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services , and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up .
34	During these exploits , Joe comes to meet Enrico " Ratso " Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) , a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money .
48	When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament , Ratso offers Joe a place to stay , and , working together , they attempt to make ( largely dishonest ) lives for themselves in the cold , gritty metropolis of New York .
39	Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex ; however , his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman ( Sylvia Miles ) twenty dollars .
18	Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent , Ratso is just as naïve as Joe .
34	Ratso , with his painful limp and hacking cough , is always assuring himself that , if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami , somehow everything would be all right .
26	Watching the film , we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso 's squalid , unheated residence , our joints stiff from the aching winter cold .
23	The acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism , with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society .
18	" Midnight Cowboy " was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic .
30	We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he 's ' one helluva stud ' who 's to doubt him ?
36	This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else , his performance here would still be legendary .
35	As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen ; even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish " Anaconda " is a source of pleasure ) .
9	The film became famous and infamous almost overnight .
38	It was a crowd-pleaser , ( even with its downbeat ending ) , funny and sexy and recognizably ' real ' ; ( it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true ) .
21	It was also the first ' X ' rated film to win the Oscar as the year 's Best Picture .
41	Adapted , ( brilliantly ) , by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial American movie to deal with ' taboo ' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner .
15	Everyone is recognizably human , warts and all , and everyone is treated sympathetically .
48	Voight 's Joe Buck is an innocent abroad , a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler , ( a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy ; he 's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker ) .
50	But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy , wormy little con-man called ' Ratso ' Rizzo , ( Dustin Hoffman , fresh from " The Graduate " and he 's a revelation ) , he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream .
22	Essentially it 's a male love story , ( though totally platonic ) , between these two not so unlikely bedfellows .
29	Both totally alone , both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other , ( Voight with his physical prowess , Hoffman with his street-wise savvy ) .
19	They are misfits adrift from the mainstream , tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others .
37	Though ' straight ' Voight is not beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself . ( The whole film posits a strangely ' Christian ' attitude ) .
6	It 's also magnificently acted .
13	On second thoughts , maybe it is a great movie after all .
3	Just kidding .
29	Seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York City , Jon Voight is young optimist Cowboy ( almost Forest Gump-like ) Joe Buck from Texas .
37	It does not take long for the Big Apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and cons from its street-thugs .
39	Given his pure heart , he takes pity on one of these thugs , Ratso Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive .
26	While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama , it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion .
34	It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying Warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban New York City .
16	The film crams Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between , thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position .
21	We feel for his struggle to fit in , but also to merely get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo .
21	Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart .
49	I imagine this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and , to an extent , the Crocodile Dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans .
12	Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend . 8.5/10
13	Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released .
20	Had me snifflin ' like a baby as I left the theatre , trying not to let anyone see .
30	So , when I saw it again now in ' 07 , I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached .
8	Thankfully this time I was at home .
27	What I had not remembered from my youthful viewing - or perhaps had not noticed because of it , was the technical brilliance of this movie .
14	The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue .
18	The camera work which seemed to place the viewer , together with the characters in the scene .
35	Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner , the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground , framing the street scene .
15	The story itself , & the characters - seedy , sad & brutally real .
25	It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn .
12	Then again , Joe & Ratso could be any of us .
10	Must have been ' 70 when I saw it .
17	I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends .
14	All these years later , I am glad I am not alone tonight .
9	This is one hell of a great movie .
28	Midnight Cowboy opens with a run down Drive In theater with the voice-over of the main character Joe Buck ( Jon Voight ) singing in the shower .
15	He is singing a cowboy song , the very thing he strives to be .
29	Joe picks up his humdrum life living in Texas and moves it to New York City with the dream of lots of women , and even more money .
23	He dresses as the epitome of the cowboy , but in a cartoonish fashion , not even his friends take him seriously .
26	He begins his journey on the bus to NYC and we can quickly see how diluted Joe is through his interactions with the other passengers .
18	This is primarily a story of Joe 's realization of the harsh realities of the real world .
21	He starts off as a very naïve southerner thinking he can make it in NYC just on his good looks .
27	He has no other reason to think otherwise , as they proved helpful in the past ; we learn this from the many flashbacks he has .
18	In the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical .
29	They are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance , as they are , they are coming out of his past .
50	However , as Joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of NYC we see more of his past , which is no longer whimsical but gritty , filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events .
20	This is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted , and her being raped .
16	In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick .
24	This mirrors the way in which Joe himself is falling apart ; the naiveté that he once carried is falling off of him .
48	He and Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman ) are living in squalor , and barely able to get food to eat ; Joe is realizing he can not live off of his looks , that there is a gritty underbelly of New York that he did not envision .
14	His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out .
24	Ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to Joe , but in an opposite way ; Ratso is Joe 's foil .
20	Joe is a handsome , strong man who , for the most part , has a good outward appearance .
30	Ratso , on the other hand , from the very first time we see him sitting next to Joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite .
15	He is short , dark , and always coated with a sheen of sweat .
30	He understands how the world works , that it is unforgiving , and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail ; just as his father did .
23	They are living in the same world , the same apartment even , but they understand things on a completely different level .
20	The theme of alienation , one that is common of this era , is very apparent in this film .
11	Neither Joe nor Ratso fit into the culture surrounding them .
18	Joe feels trapped in Texas and moves to NYC where he is still very much an outsider .
28	Ratso , living in the cold of NYC , wishes to move to sunny Florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life .
31	Even though this is his ideal , in the fantasy we get from Ratso 's perspective , it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society .
25	In said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him , he is yet again an outsider , alienated from society .
17	It is not until the end that the gap between Joe and Ratso begins to narrow .
31	Joe resorts to violence ; he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for Florida for himself and Ratso .
28	On the journey we see Joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film .
16	He is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to Florida for vacation .
28	He dresses Ratso the same way ; he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering , but it is to no avail .
19	Upon Ratso 's death on the bus , their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders .
25	Even in this new culture they have entered , they can not escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film .
46	Despite the Ratso 's death , and Joe 's continued alienation , the film ends with the hope that Joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in NYC .
25	Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society , and alienation , with stellar performances by both Voight and Hoffman .
23	After Racism , Rural exodus - also known as migration from the country side - is another socio-political issue of the 1960s .
15	WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view .
17	Now , Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view .
19	It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away .
25	Director John Schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts , dreams , fantasies , fears and evaluations of two New York City scums .
46	While the handsome Joe Buck ( Voight ) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy , the poor Ratso Rizzo ( Hoffman ) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida .
27	Accordingly , Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality ; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida .
14	Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can .
7	They begin sharing everything in life .
25	They share food , they share medicine , they share an uninhabited home , they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny .
16	The Might is always right , and the Feeble has no right in the daylight .
10	Thence , " Midnight " gives the factual sight .
12	Despite the tragedy , there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy .
17	Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate .
19	Thanks to this , Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue , the rural exodus .
23	Fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man .
33	Extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline , extremely well-directed by John Schlesinger ( who never topped his work here ) and superbly acted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman .
35	Packs quite a punch overall , yet the " fantasy " scenes -- some of which are played for a chuckle -- are mildly intrusive , as is the " mod " drug party .
40	The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental , yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy , and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than Schlesinger .
36	Originally X-rated in 1969 , and the winner of the Best Picture Oscar ; screenwriter Waldo Salt ( who adapted James Leo Herilhy 's book ) and Schlesinger also won statues . *** 1/2 from ****
44	It 's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered , but 1969 's " Midnight Cowboy " is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time .
23	The film 's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee 's " Brokeback Mountain " .
26	The meandering plot follows Joe Buck , a naive , young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women .
22	Full of energy but lacking any savvy , he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances .
23	He meets a cynical , sickly petty thief named " Ratso " Rizzo , who first sees Joe as an easy pawn .
15	The two become dependent on one another , and Rizzo begins to manage Joe .
19	Things come to a head at a psychedelic , drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client .
19	Meanwhile , Rizzo becomes sicker , and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life .
39	This is not a story that will appeal to everyone , in fact , some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures , yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic .
24	In his first major role , Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe 's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities .
37	As Rizzo , Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean , post-college image from " The Graduate " and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe .
26	The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger 's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time .
20	The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character 's fragile psyches .
20	Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story .
47	The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters , including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party , Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron , John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner .
31	The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living .
15	' Midnight Cowboy ' was rated X with the original release back in 1969 .
14	There are some scenes where you can understand that , just a little .
26	The movie about Joe Buck ( Jon Voight ) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing .
21	Dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler , making money by the act of love .
9	It does not work out as he planned .
27	After a guy named Rico ' Ratso ' Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends .
10	They live in an empty and very filthy apartment .
14	Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money .
20	The movie was probably rated X for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things .
8	The editing in this movie is great .
21	We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way .
13	Dustin Hoffman , Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances .
8	Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines .
11	The score is done by John Barry and sounds great .
18	All this makes this a great movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for a good reason .
14	At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie .
27	I referred to it as the most important movie I 'd seen in ten years , and found myself bumping into people who said similar things .
8	Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook .
20	And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had , into a corrosive , adult world-view .
40	Just as Catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for Christ , here Sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place ; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection .
18	It 's the only value system implicated in the films world , outside of Bernhards arty confusion .
28	For a nation whose chief issues are racism and money , it 's refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way .
26	Joe Buck ( Jon Voight ) decides he 's going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City .
42	The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly " tutti-fruttis . " Wide-eyed , he comes to New York City , not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences , one worse than the other .
32	In the middle of that chaos , he meets and befriends Rico " Ratso " Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffmann ) , a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building .
17	We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this .
22	I sat down to watch " Midnight Cowboy " thinking it would be another overrated ' 60s / ' 70s movie .
43	I sort of feel this way about " Easy Rider . " ( Although it , too , is one of my favorites . ) So , I did not expect much from " Midnight Cowboy " but got a lot back .
19	It 's a touching story , well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time .
21	Half of the film 's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood .
31	Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck , the " cowboy " who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute .
38	Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named " Ratso " - who offers to become Joe 's " manager " for a certain percentage of profits .
15	The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long .
49	Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated ( similar to the drug odysseys in " Easy Rider " ) and really harms its flow because it 's not needed .
15	Other than that , " Midnight Cowboy " is an almost flawless motion picture .
5	I was pleasantly surprised .
3	Highly recommended .
20	The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic 's Top 100 .
34	For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie ; indeed , I had to look hard to find a copy , I got the DVD version for about half-price .
13	Surprisingly it was only rated M15 + ( the uncut version ) .
21	I doubt many will take notice of this review ( more like comment ) so I will make it brief .
31	This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I have seen , partly because of the use of montages , artistic filming ( very art-house ) and the unusual theme .
29	There are many things in the film I still do not understand ( I have seen it twice ) , and it makes for an emotionally confusing film .
22	The filming and acting were very good , and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable .
24	The main character is Joe Buck , a ' cowboy ' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute .
23	He meets the crippled conman Enrico ' Ratso ' Rizzo and , of course they become friends going through the usual escapades .
13	What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different .
35	I felt the film did not really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection , although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic .
19	You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews , but its pretty obvious from the start .
13	I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes .
19	The deprivation of humanity ( shown by the darkness of the city streets , the breaking-down tenements ) .
27	Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law ( a conman , giggolo . etc ) yet you can not help liking them .
25	Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic , while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film .
18	I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period .
20	At the time ( And even now ) it was definitely not a typical movie ( quite art-house ) .
28	At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns , musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up .
14	On a personal level , I must say I quite liked the film .
7	The imagery conveyed a dream-like quality .
25	I particularly liked the scene at the party , the music , images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching .
25	However , as a movie for entertainment 's sake it was a bit lacking ( not really my style of movie ) in thrills .
18	This is a film to be savoured and appreciated , rather than a cheap thrills action flick .
21	Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film , the characters and their motives were quite interesting .
33	From what I understand from the flashbacks , Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother , although it still does not seem to be relevant to the story .
13	He is a happy-go-lucky young stud , who suppresses his darker memories .
10	The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling .
24	Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso , although I fail to see where they have got the idea from .
39	The theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation , and later in Joe Buck 's encounter with a lonely old man , but it has little to do with the main story .
45	Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade ( it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel ) and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do .
31	While it has a simple , sentimental story to it ( disguised by a hard edge ) the beauty of the film is in the strange , often psychedelic sequences .
19	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing .
46	I was too young to watch it when it was originally released , and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago , but it has absolutely stood the test of time , and I have watched it several times since .
31	It 's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one .
12	Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools . 10/10
32	Virile , but naive , big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring , Texas , and hustles off to the Big Apple in search of women and big bucks .
23	In NYC , JB meets up with frustration , and with " Ratso " Rizzo , a scruffy but cordial con artist .
35	Somehow , this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty , sometimes brutal , urban America , en route to a poignant ending .
39	The film 's direction is masterful ; the casting is perfect ; the acting is top notch ; the script is crisp and cogent ; the cinematography is engaging ; and the music enhances all of the above .
27	Deservedly , it won the best picture Oscar of 1969 , and I would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade .
39	If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre ( Voight and Hoffman are a superb match ) , well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction , editing and cinematography , you will love this just as much as I did .
43	Schlesinger paints a vivid , always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it 's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality , poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street , New York City .
29	The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement ( and of the city ) and are nothing less than dazzling .
44	I have seen many ideas ( including the rapid-fire editing , the handling of the voice-over flashbacks , the drug / trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror ) stolen by other filmmakers .
28	The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it 's homosexual underpinnings .
45	I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times , but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life , whether it be sexual or not .
46	MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave , moving film of magnitude , influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it 's impact over the years , so if you have not seen it , you are really missing out on a true American classic .
7	I recommend this film to everyone .
7	Score : 10 out of 10 .
28	Young , handsome , muscular Joe Buck ( Jon Voight ) moves from Texas to New York thinking he will make a living by being a stud .
25	He gets there and finds out quickly that it is not going to be easy -- he goes through one degrading experience after another .
20	At the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled , sleazy Ratso Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) .
16	Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida .
6	But will they make it ?
8	Very dark , disturbing yet fascinating movie .
14	Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants .
25	In that way it 's dated -- the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it 's cleaned up considerably by now .
44	He also uses every camera trick in the book -- color turning to black & white ; trippy dream sequences ; flash forwards ; flash backs ( especially involving a rape ) ; shock cuts ; weird sound effects ... you name it .
15	It keeps you disoriented and off center -- but I could not stop watching .
19	There is not much of a story -- it basically centers on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck .
20	There is an implication that they may have been lovers ( the final shot sort of shows that ) .
21	It 's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold , cruel , urban jungle .
26	This was originally rated X in 1969--the only reason being that the MPAA did not think that parents would want their children to see this .
21	Nevertheless , it was a big hit with high schoolers ( back then X meant no one under 17 ) .
19	It also has been the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award as Best Picture .
30	Hoffman and Voight were up for acting awards as was ( mysteriously ) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of ( maybe ) 5 minutes !
19	It was eventually lowered to an R ( with no cuts ) when it was reissued in 1980 .
22	Also the excellent song " Everybody 's Talkin ' " was introduced in this film -- and became a big hit .
8	A great film --- but very dark .
7	I am giving it a 10 .
16	Do not see it on commercial TV -- it 's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible .
23	I typically do not like reality shows , particularly the ones that are profiting off of " American Idol " 's success .
8	But this one I can live with .
35	Comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts , and if they like them , those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience .
24	Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do " Survivor " style competitions using comedic tactics .
32	Then one will be determined as " Last Comic Standing . " I do like stand up comedy , so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests .
10	There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through .
18	It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden , Ralphie May , and Josh Blue .
27	My negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama .
26	At first they lived together in a house like " Big Brother , " but now they have done away with that , thank God .
42	And there are a lot of comedians I felt , were only chosen not because they are funny , but because of race , ethnicity , attitude , sex , etc . when other comics clearly should 've beaten them out .
23	But overall , it 's a well-made reality show , which are two terms up until now I thought were an oxymoron .
17	Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic does not always win out over imagination .
34	We all know that killers like Freddy , Jason , Michael and even Leatherface should not be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day .
21	Most of us do not believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains .
32	And let us hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them .
9	This is where imagination wins out over fact .
26	Horror , and most films in general , requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow .
38	This usually is not a problem when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near Burketsville .
28	But what I do have a problem digesting ( without wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this film .
48	To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself , but just suffice to say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed .
24	There are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is .
27	But the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done , suspenseful , blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by John Hough .
20	If the film would have offered me a different killer , then I would actually be raving about it .
31	This may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film , but believe me , anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me .
7	John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell .
23	He and his daughter Jenny ( played beautifully by Erin Flannery ) have just recently moved to this small New England town .
14	Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died .
30	We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour .
10	Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed .
24	Again , I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway .
15	Cassevetes , it has to be mentioned , is strange to say the least .
21	Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental .
11	There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities .
21	It never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent , but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug .
20	Thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy .
17	Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen great James Caan .
20	He has a deceptive smile and a virile , commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice .
18	But he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene .
15	He just has that slimy , disingenuous , phlegmatic , uneasy way about him .
13	He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film .
17	I guess that is a credit to the writers , the director and to Cassevetes himself .
15	There was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go .
19	The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry .
22	There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see , something or someone is watching them .
27	When the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck , the young woman wanders into the shed , just to play a prank .
9	Once she is there , she is attacked .
20	The young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail .
16	Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in .
25	He looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner , and then smacko , the guy gets it .
17	It is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note .
42	Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces .
27	Tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place , he has another dream .
40	Toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother , a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen .
26	Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time , the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped .
24	This is my first feeble ( and careful ) attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement .
9	It just did not strike the right chord .
8	The Incubus is a well done film .
16	It is tense , tight and even most of the performances are very well done .
30	I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders .
25	But when you get through all that was good in the film , you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth .
25	And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones . 7 out of 10 -- This could have been a nine .
3	Too bad .
15	Shocking , well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces .
20	Small town doctor tries to discover who , or what , is committing a series of violent sexual murders .
22	Incubus is a tight mystery , with some horrific murder sequences , that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist .
18	The murder scenes are intense and gory , so this is not a film for the squeamish !
28	The direction of John Hough , along with a bizarre music score , combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film .
11	It also carries a kind of Gothic vibe as well .
11	Nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight .
7	The cast is not bad either .
15	The great John Cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town .
29	Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as the local reporter , Helen Hughes as the town historian , and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teen .
20	All around Incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated . *** out of ****
47	This is a wonderful film ... First impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women 's baser motivations diverge ( Vive la difference ! ) You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses .
22	Human beings are a bit rubbish really , but we have big hearts and we try our best , despite temptation .
20	It 's not our fault when sometimes temptation can not be resisted , that 's just who we are .
34	There is a consistent stylishness from start to finish ; crisp photography and sharp composition , very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content , well suited music and laugh out loud scripting .
24	Watch out for the very young " lone wise voice " ... brilliant ; wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition .
21	This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad , unfortunate death at the box office .
22	I saw this film at a local art cinema , in revival form , shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas .
16	It certainly deserves to be approached a second time ( or even a third ) .
45	Sandra B. takes it to the limit by doing spoken word & taking on some well known songs in this piece ( her version of Hank William 's ' I am So Lonesome I Could Cry ' could easily move you to tears ) .
27	Maybe someday , audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously ( but not without some well placed laughs , too ) .
27	The film moves at a brisk pace ( thanks to some nice editing ) , so that some viewers will not find it stale & boring .
9	Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline .
11	This is truly the greatest Swedish movie of all time .
28	Not only is it revolutionary in its narration , but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians .
7	This is a very funny movie !
14	I have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not .
23	However , I do think men all over the world can identify with " Frank " and his thoughts to some extent !
16	These thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie I am sure !
29	All cast members perform well , and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in England or the US .
20	But for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand Swedish , you are in for a treat !
3	Highly recommended .
47	High energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933 , The Bowery places saloon owner and operator Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy , George Raft , with adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and good looking Faye Wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry .
21	It 's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about , but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids .
17	Plenty of wisecracks at the beginning , but the characters soften up as the film progresses .
15	Apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in Beery 's saloon .
41	The various characters , sexy chorus line , lots of drinking , a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so-called pre-code restrictions , and then later come the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation herself .
15	It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that 's long gone .
23	I do not like to compare eras , but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today .
17	The film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see .
6	I love this freekin movie !
21	Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form , his film have been sometimes in my opinion , overlooked .
22	I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact .
8	Can I get it somewhere on DVD ?
8	I have only seen it on TV .
20	But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one .
35	In Brooklyn a century ago , the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to Brodie 's famous bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge .
26	This is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a Bugs Bunny spoof , " Bowery Bugs " from 1949 .
49	This generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some Chinese tenement dwellers -- a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes , giving the film a great deal of historical interest , in my view .
17	Four words account for why this film was made - " She Done Him Wrong " .
23	The huge commercial success of that Mae West vehicle convinced the studio brass that Gay ' 90s melodramas were a viable proposition .
21	Here we are rewarded with a fast moving , well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars .
36	Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals ; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take , but it is Fay Wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress .
36	With a strong director - as Walsh proves himself to be - Wray could carry a lot of punch , and she is utterly believable as the object of both Raft and Beery 's affection .
16	Lots of atmosphere , beautifully designed , this is a forgotten film worthy of revival .
33	George Raft as Steve Brodie , the carefree , dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare , is pitted against the lumbering , sentimental , Chuck Connors ( Wallace Beery ) .
45	A soft touch for every panhandler , Connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays , notably runaway orphan " Swipes " ( Jackie Cooper , complete with kittens ! ) and the homeless Lucy Calhoun , an out-of-town innocent with ambitions to become a writer .
27	In this male-dominated culture , communication takes place mostly in the form of violence ( one sees why THE BOWERY is a Martin Scorsese favorite ) .
7	A minor but admirable little film .
50	A favourite of mine , this movie tells of two feuding New York " characters " , Steve Brodie ( Raft ) and " Chuck " Connors ( Beery ) , who both strive to be the " Main Guy " in the Bowery in the late Nineteenth Century .
31	Brodie ( 1863-1901 ) and Connors ( 1852-1913 ) , were real people , though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics ( based on a play ) .
36	Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period , so beautifully recreated here , and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray ( a young Pert Kelton ) .
32	Raft is at his slickest as Brodie , and Beery shows again what a clever actor he was , as tough , big hearted , and at times quite touching Connors .
13	Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing .
24	Full of life and energy , " The Bowery " moves at a fast pace ( unlike many early " talkies " ) .
17	It is not an easy movie to find , but is well worth looking out for .
28	Culled from the real life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890s New York , " The Bowery " is high energy and good natured .
19	But be warned : Casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper .
8	The very first shot might be startling .
16	This is true to the time it was set and the time it was made .
16	And it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods .
11	It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere .
24	Beery as Connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action , a loud-mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade .
11	And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper .
16	Raft as Brodie is Connors ' slicker , better looking rival in almost every endeavor .
35	Brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention , leading up to a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge ( it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy ) .
12	Beery is as bombastic as ever with a put-on Irish-American accent .
18	He is just the gruff sort of character to draw children , cats and ladies in distress .
31	This is possibly the most boisterous character Raft ever played , and he even gets to throw in a little dancing ( as well as a show of leg ) .
16	And again he mistakes the leading lady ( lovely Fay Wray ) for a prostitute .
20	Cooper is as tough as either of them , though he gets a chance to turn on the tears .
29	The highlight is not the jump off the bridge but a no-holds-barred fistfight between Connors and Brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals .
10	It 's sure someone bruised more than an ego .
22	Did Sandra ( yes , she must have ) know we would still be here for her some nine years later ?
19	See it if you have not , again if you have ; see her live while you can .
13	There is something about Pet Sematary that I never felt anywhere else .
18	Maybe the fact I was a kid when I first watched it made this experience so memorable .
22	But as I keep watching it over and over again , it never gets old , and I never get bored .
41	From the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending , there is something insane , sad and scary at the same time , and it keeps ringing in your head : sometimes dead is better !
15	I do not think it would be useful to relate the whole story again .
45	All you need to know is it starts from point A ( the most perfect situation for a happy American family ) and step by step drowns to point B ( which is , believe me , the very end of all joy ) .
30	The music is perfect , the story makes sense , the special effects are cool , and the Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I would be .
9	Like I said , sometimes dead is better !
21	If you ever have the chance to see Sandra Bernhard live in person , you better move on it sweetie .
42	I saw her last year in Los Angeles at the opening of her Everything Bad and Beautiful tour and i still can not believe that i was in the first row , and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show .
28	She is now in New York with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner , " Without You I am Nothing " .
19	We have lost Richard Pryor , Lenny Bruce , Nina Simone , but Sandra is still with us .
11	Patti Smith is missing in action , but not Sandra .
23	Barbara Streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but Sandra more than makes up for where Babs leaves off .
19	Okay , i want it known , Ms. Bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more .
32	It is my opinion that many ( and i mean , MANY ) comics have lifted , okay outright stolen , so much from this show if not from Sandra herself .
19	I will not name names but come on , people , you and i know who they are .
13	See , the thing is , Bernhard plays by her own rules .
33	This movie shows , as does her live performances , that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business , as well as pushing forward .
43	Her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs ( during the time of Miles Davis , Coltrane , Monk ) , 70 's TV shows , intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from Judy Garland to Joan Jett .
15	Most comedians could not even touch where Sandra is coming from or going to .
24	So , here i was , a year ago , watching Sandra at the Silent Movie Theater , in total awe and joy .
27	I wanted to meet her after the show , give her something that meant something to me , that , hopefully would mean something to her .
35	But i listen to my copy of Giving Til it Hurts , and just thank her in a prayer , of sorts for making me laugh , making me think , making me FEEL .
23	You can not deny this lady 's presence and you certainly can not deny the talent that just rushes from the stage .
24	She 's still here , damn it , even after the release of Without You I am Nothing , some 15 years ago .
9	And she looks great , by the way .
19	Overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come .
16	Although the plot is not 100 % accurate to the book most everything is correct .
13	The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts .
38	Overall I give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts ( relative accuracy and overall making sense ) and for its bad parts ( large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies ) .
23	Personally , I absolutely love this movie and novel ( I read the book first and decided to see the movie ) .
14	First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind .
11	The acting is also great and i love the cast .
18	Judd Crandall ( plays Fred Gwynne ) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you .
35	There are also a few corny lines thrown in there ( Idk if they were meant to be corny ) , but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh .
23	The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie .
28	Not only will you love it but you will want to see it again and again , I recommend this 100 % to any horror fan ! !
21	Ah , clichés , clichés , clichés ; They are a main part of a wide variety of horror films .
9	This one , has a lot of them .
15	Still , it 's Stephen King , one of the best masters of horror .
10	This movie was really good , just TOO predictable .
10	And what horror movie does not have stupid people ?
17	This one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken .
10	Pet Semetary I found to be creepy a little .
14	The way everything is set up was REALLY spooky , but not terrifying .
38	For the most part , the acting was SOMEWHAT believable , the suspense was not that suspenseful , but the entertainment level is set at a major rank ; My eyes were practically glued to the screen .
20	All Stephen King fans must see this movie , but as for anyone else , expect an OKAY thriller .
9	Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet .
10	Not surprising , since King himself wrote the screenplay .
13	The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house .
21	One of the other residents is Jud , a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area .
11	One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard .
24	The other is a path leading to the Pet Sematary , where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway .
14	Soon enough , Ellie Creed 's cat , Church , is found dead .
23	Luckily , this happens while the family , with the exception of Louis ( the father ) , is away for Thanksgiving .
20	Jud takes Louis to another burial ground , beyond the Pet Sematary , where Church is to be buried .
13	Later , Louis is greeted ( not so politely ) by Church .
20	He 's returned , appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in .
6	Maybe he was buried alive .
3	Maybe not .
10	Nothing more I can say without ruining the story .
15	Of all the King adaptions I have seen this would be the most terrifying .
10	The characters are real and the situations are normal .
10	Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings .
17	Suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film , due in part to the plot development .
13	The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever .
10	Then , of course , we have the conclusion .
23	Easy to determine what 's going to happen , but Lambert pulls off some genuinely scary , and sometimes disturbing , moments .
12	Overall , this is a good film and an excellent adaption .
29	If you enjoy being scared and do not mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then " Pet Sematary " is just what you are looking for .
9	Non Horror fans will want to avoid this .
20	So often with Stephen King adaptations , you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books .
9	This really captures the heart of the book .
31	Maybe because they Do not use large chunks of text straight from the book , but it 's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story .
13	A big part of its success is Miko Hughes as baby Gage .
15	Dale Midkiff and Denise " Tasha Yar " Crosby really act like his parents .
17	There is a scene where Louis is cuddling Gage , and they are very natural together .
5	Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL .
28	He nails the Maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody , and is wise and warm just like Jud should be . ( 8 out of 10 )
22	Ok , first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old .
33	If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time , I ´ d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-TV horror film with some well-made scenes .
16	But when you ´ re nine you just don ´ t care about those facts .
23	This scared the hell out of me back then , especially those aforementioned Zelda - scenes ( and they still do ) .
11	Nowadays I ´ m kind of hooked to this film .
32	I have to see this maybe once in a month , and on every new year ´ s eve I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends .
11	It ´ s like an appetizer for a good party !
16	I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense .
32	Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like , but one can ´ t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two .
15	Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which " the Creeds " underact .
39	What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary , and I don ´ t mean the zombie stuff here .
15	THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND .
35	Honestly , how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-TV one , but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there ?
33	Alright I busted some of the cast ´ s balls a minute ago , but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection .
17	But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary !
33	I really would love to know ... And I don ´ t mean night of the living dead here ... this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .
9	***** Spoilers herein ***** What really scares you ?
13	Killer sharks , or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message ?
6	Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath ?
2	Maybe .
19	I have read comments about this film that include poor acting , characters making stupid decisions , etc .
3	I disagree .
12	The acting is actually first rate for a film like this .
16	Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario .
22	But the film 's events are not only logical , they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible .
8	Despite warning , or even past history .
18	The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart .
16	The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect .
6	And the results are horrifying .
32	In fact , when the film dives into slasher territory near the end , it 's almost a letdown , although I believe it 's perfectly logical how it got there .
22	I am a true horror fan , and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made .
15	If you do not think so , see it again after you have children .
8	MINOR SPOILER Underrated little Stephen King shocker .
39	It 's not perfect , by any stretch of the imagination -- even if the limp performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better , there 'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with .
35	The old Micmac burial ground , Rachel 's terminally ill sister , and the Jacob-Marley-an Victor Pascow never really come together into anything coherent , and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed .
32	It 's politically incorrect , it 's tasteless , it 's gratuitous -- and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way ` safer ' horror movies never can .
32	Add to that one of Fred Gwynne 's best performances and Mary Lambert 's witty direction , and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie -- even with the hokey ending .
11	Highly recommended for genre fans . 7.5 out of 10 .
10	" Pet Sematary " succeeds on two major situations .
9	First , it 's a scary Horror movie .
10	Those that just are not produced in these days .
11	Second , it 's an emotional , clever movie overall .
34	So if you are looking for chills , scares , creepiness and visually stunning settings , great acting , dialongs , and gruesome effects ; this is the movie you are looking for .
13	A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan .
12	Probably , the best adaptation to any of King 's novels .
29	The events feel a little rushed compared with the novel , but that does not means that this underrated movie is not a complete Horror / Drama accomplishment .
18	Stephen King 's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time .
26	The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there is a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it 's members .
40	Then , when everything seems to be happiness ( technically happy , because the title " Pet Sematary " does not offers appiness ! ) a tragic event changes the movie 's atmosphere , now it turns very dark .
25	The movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits , but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad , gray , creepy .
28	Dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family 's entire life , and " Pet Sematary " proves it dramatically .
33	The legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience , but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot .
15	Sadly enough , the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead .
25	The previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it 's something much , much worse .
12	What will happened with the lives of our All American family ?
6	Could Pascow prevent this tragedy ?
8	What is it with the surreal nightmares ?
20	Watch " Pet Sematary " to witness one of the most touching , emotional Horror movies of recent times .
5	You will not regret .
17	The acting is very good although I did not dig the actor who portrayed the father .
14	He did not seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation .
7	But that 's just my opinion .
17	Denise Crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble , tender mother .
14	Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts . * Shivers * .
39	Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people 's deepest fears ... the loss of someone you love , the dead returning to life , and a feeling of desperation .
18	Something is for sure ... I do not wanna be buried , in a pet sematary ! !
17	Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea .
34	When people read the book , they automatically start making their own " mental movie " of who the characters look like , the places they exist in , how the situations progress .
48	And everybody 's mind 's - eye opus is different , which is why when the ' REAL ' movie finally comes out , you are always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just does not measure up .
38	All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is , and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see .
19	There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King .
45	Although it 's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation , PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book , that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings .
23	Since the majority of you know the story , I will not put you to sleep with too many of the details .
20	Dr. Louis Creed ( Dale Midkiff ) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country .
34	Well , almost perfect , except for two nasty little details : the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front , and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back .
31	Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son ... well , even if you have not read the book , do the frickin ' math .
17	It IS a King story , after all , so no mystery where this is headed .
19	It 's not so much the destination that counts here , but the spooky stops along the way .
22	And that third act ... if it does not give you a few nightmares , maybe you should check your pulse .
47	This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up , though the scenes where he 's featured are still masterfully staged , ( especially Gwynne 's death scene . ) Other than that , everything else is still about as good as it gets .
27	CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I am concerned ; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five .
21	Still , will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story ?
7	Not BLOODY likely ... for now .
21	Well , this might be one of the funniest movies of all time , and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance !
46	Alas , her career never quite took off , but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures : " The King Of Comedy " , " Dallas Doll " , and " Without You I am Nothing " .
25	She dons into different personas from New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America .
29	Sexy and fierce , tender and sensual , philosophical and melancholic , she convinces the audience in every scene , and she actually IS " really pretty " .
19	Watch this one ( if you are not from Iowa ) , you will certainly enjoy it ! !
15	This is one of the creepiest , scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie EVER !
33	I am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on Stephen King 's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable .
22	I have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and I still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary .
20	The scene where Gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out .
20	And the " No fair " uttered by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance .
17	" Pet Sematary " is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title .
23	The story follows the Creeds - an all American , middle-class family , who move into a house out in the country .
22	The family consists of Louis and Rachel , and their two young children , Ellie and their toddler son , Gage .
26	The house could not be better , and the family meets a strange but friendly old man , Jud , who lives across the road .
27	He leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves .
19	And just beyond there , lies a sacred Indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power .
34	When the family cat , Church , is killed , Louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough , soon after , Church returns to life .
20	But there is something evil about him now , he is not the same cat he used to be .
37	And when a tragic accident takes the life of young Gage , Louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son ... unfortunately , he gets more than he bargained for .
20	Having read Stephen King 's novel , I can say that the book is much better than the film .
22	Not to say the movie is bad , because it is not - the book is just a little bit better .
30	The real strength in this film lies in it 's story , which is both bizarre but extremely original , something that King 's stories are typically known for .
27	The script is very well adapted from the story , and while it minorly differs in some aspects , it 's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation .
14	There are a few plot holes here and there , nothing major though .
21	Besides that , this movie is actually pretty scary , and it succeeds in it 's intention to do so .
30	There are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film , and I 'd have to say that the flashback sequence of Rachel 's sister Zelda is the number one .
35	Honestly , that is one of the most disgusting , disturbing things I have ever seen in a horror film - it 's not gory and bloody , it 's just flat out sickening .
16	One thing 's for sure , that image will not leave your head anytime soon .
19	The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there .
33	This film is actually on the gory side , there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there , including the shocker of an ending .
28	I really liked the way they ended the film , it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive , but it worked better that way with all things considered .
33	Overall , " Pet Sematary " is a good horror movie that I 'd recommend to those who are fans of either Stephen King or just fans of the genre in general .
16	The story is the film 's greatest asset and it 's a creepy one too .
13	One of the better Stephen King adaptations I 'd say . 7/10 .
33	Louis Creed , a doctor from Chicago , moves to a large house near a small town , since he is going to be giving classes in the University of Maine 's .
26	Along with him , is his wife Rachel and their two kids , Ellie and Gage , as well as Ellie 's cat , Church .
15	Soon , they met their new neighbor , and old man named Judd Crandall .
46	Judd not only warns Louis and Rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house ( that is constantly a way used by big trucks ) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house .
37	Judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery , but Rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children , since she has traumas from her sister Zelda 's death .
7	Anyway , he dismisses the dream .
20	Many strange things starts to happen and Church , Ellie 's cat , dies while walking on the highway .
37	Louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about Church 's death with Ellie , but Judd , sympathizing with him , Jud takes Louis to the pet cemetery , supposedly to bury Church .
40	But instead of stopping there , Jud leads Louis farther on a frightening journey to " the real cemetery " : an ancient burial ground that was once used by the Micmac ( ' ... Indians ... ' ) .
23	There Louis buries the cat on Jud 's instruction , with Jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life .
18	And that is where the real horror story begins ... I personally find this movie very good .
21	It 's not THE most horrifying of all , but it is one of the best horror movies I watched .
20	The way Gage dies , is almost impossible to not stay in your memory , specially being a toddler .
16	It 's cool to see Stephen King 's cameo as the minister of the funeral .
35	Of course , there are some script errors : How can a rich doctor with two small kids , goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house ?
14	How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck ?
20	Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters ?
27	Things like that does not make any sense , but I can understand that all horror 's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work .
44	A good thing I saw in this movie , is the necessity to talk about death with the children , no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist , and also that avoiding important subjects does not help anything .
29	Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie , confronting her and saying that her cat would not be back again , all the nightmare began .
20	As this happens to be one of most favorite novels , I was very excited to see the move .
5	I was not disappointed !
33	Yes of course there are a few things that I could pick on , but I think that the movie stuck true to the book , and was a really good movie .
21	It seems that Stephen King films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones .
42	It is such a dark story , which I guess is why I like it . . and what is better than the dead coming to life . . and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too .
18	If you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book ! !
36	In the trivia section for Pet Sematary , it mentions that George Romero ( director of two Stephen King stories , Creepshow and The Dark Half ) was set to direct and then pulled out .
46	One wonders what he would 've brought to the film , as the director Mary Lambert , while not really a bad director , does not really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King 's novel , of which he wrote the screenplay .
43	There are of course some very effective , grotesquely surreal scenes ( mainly involving the sister Zelda , likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film ) , and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect .
33	And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters , who plays this old , secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone .
12	And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek .
48	But there are some other flaws though in the other casting ; Dale Midkiff is good , not great , as the conflicted , disturbed father figure Creed , and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just did not work for me at all .
26	For the most part it 's a very polished directing job , though it could 've been made even darker to correspond with the script .
25	If thought out in logical terms ( albeit in King terms ) it is really one of his more effective works of the period .
13	But it does not add up like it could , or should .
11	Still , it makes for a nifty little midnight movie .
19	Pet Semetary ( 1989 ) 9/10 The Creed family have just moved into the small town of Ludlow .
24	The family consists of a father , Louis , a mother , Rachel , a brother Gage , and a daughter , Ellen .
9	They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall .
16	Jud is 89 , and could basically tell you about the entire history of Ludlow .
22	Behind the Creed 's new house , there is a path leading to a pet cemetery ( spelled pet sematary ) .
19	When Ellen wants to go up to see it , Jud willfully takes the family on a trip .
11	That is the start of hell for the Creed family .
14	When Rachel and the kids are gone , Ellen 's cat Church dies .
30	Jud feels that Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat , so he suggests Louis follow him further up the path , past the pet cemetery .
14	Jud tells Louis of this burial ground , once used by Micmac Indians .
9	Louis buries Church , without Jud 's help .
15	A couple of days later , Church returns , alive , but from hell .
10	The music in this movie plays an extravagant part .
10	It is at the same time sad and mysterious .
9	It goes along with the movie wonderfully . 9/10
24	I am a big fan of Stephen King 's work , and this film has made me an even greater fan of King .
8	Pet Sematary is about the Creed family .
14	They have just moved into a new house , and they seem happy .
10	But there is a pet cemetery behind their house .
21	The Creed 's new neighbor Jud ( played by Fred Gwyne ) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery .
7	That burial ground is pure evil .
31	Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being ( or any kind of pet ) up in the burial ground , they would come back to life .
22	The only problem , is that when they come back , they are NOT the same person , they are evil .
17	Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary , everything starts to go to hell .
21	I wont explain anymore because I do not want to give away some of the main parts in the film .
18	The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good , but needed a little bit of work .
21	The story was one of the main parts of this movie , mainly because it was so original and gripping .
18	This film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie , and frightening .
22	One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back , was in fact the make-up effects .
12	There is one character in this film that is truly freaky .
22	That character is " Zelda . " This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise .
20	Zelda is Rachel Creed 's sister who passed away years before , but Rachel is still haunted by her .
44	The first time Zelda appears in the movie is not generally scary because she is not talking or anything , but the second time is the worst , and to be honest , the second time scares the living **** out of me .
14	There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie , it is almost perfect .
19	Pet Sematary delivers great scares , some pretty good acting , first rate plot , and mesmerizing make-up .
18	This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time . 10 out of 10 .
27	Pet Sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a Stephen King novel .
21	Mary Lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across King 's creepy story pretty well .
13	Most people may avoid this , but they should check it out .
15	One of the best ( if not the best ) Stephen King 's screenings .
48	Dark as dark can be , surprising non-hollywood ending , terrifying atmosphere , amazing book adaptation , outstanding cast , educational ( do not play with afterlife ) , in short - everything an excellent horror should be ... My favorite horror movie , straight 10 + .
26	Sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of American pop culture to an audience that does not completely see it .
32	In L.A. she 's playing to a predominantly black audience , trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is " Shashonna , " a Madonna-look-alike stripper .
36	And even then , with Shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from " Like a Virgin , " there is not much to be said for the audience 's enjoyment of the show .
14	The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone .
20	A funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping Shashonna out of her pants .
36	Her depictions of interactions with the likes of Calvin Klein , Jerry Lewis , Bianca Jagger , Ralph Lauren and ( what we are lead to believe is ) Warren Beatty are fictional and hilarious .
21	Dressed as a Cosmo girl , Sandra retells her young-girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss .
45	At the same time , the idealized , fictional incarnation of Sandra -- her self-generated mirror image -- floats around town , a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the Kabala , studying chemistry and listening to NWA rap music .
35	In Without You I am Nothing , Sandra Bernhard explores emotions and existences that , up until then , she 'd only toyed with as a regular guest on Late Night With David Letterman .
38	Her almost child-like enthusiasm for shock , exhibited throughout the ' 80s , is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure , and her confidence in the face of materialism and American celebrity proves refreshing .
22	This approach to comedy would change Sandra 's direction forever and mark the more mature , more personable entertainer to come .
39	If you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour , celebrity , sex , loneliness , despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship , this movie will keep you in stitches .
12	It may not be meant to be funny across the board .
12	Perhaps it 's a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some .
25	But consider the emptiness of the world Sandra paints for you , and you will understand just how funny and brilliant she really is .
23	But see Without You I am Nothing with a friend " in the know " because it 's definitely funnier that way .
23	Before you know it , the two of you will be trading Sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else .
40	This scary and rather gory adaptation of Stephen King 's great novel features outstanding central performances by Dale Midkiff , Fred Gwynne ( who sadly died few years ago ) and Denise Crosby and some really gruesome gore effects .
36	Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style , and manages to make this one of the few versions of King 's work that is not only worth seeing , but genuinely unnerving .
35	The depiction of the zombie child Gage ( Miko Hughes-later in " New Nightmare " ) is equally noteworthy , as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky .
39	As for the people , who think that this one is not scary-watch it alone in the dark ( eventually with your squeamish girlfriend ) and I guarantee you that " Pet Sematary " will creep you out .
21	Some horror movies like this one or " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " should not be watched in group .
5	Recommended for horror fans !
47	I have screened this movie several times here at college , and every time I show it , the number of people watching with me grows exponentially ... in addition to the virgins , anyone I have already shown it to NEEDS to see it again !
41	Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed , poorly written , horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing I own ( no small statement , friends ) .
26	For me nothing compares 2 U , Pia ... and I do not suppose I am the only one who 's ever felt this way !
8	I kind of liked The Lonely Lady .
5	Give Pia a break .
10	She looks great and she has really nice eyes .
6	What 's not to like ?
20	The scene where she gets raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel .
16	Actually , a LOT of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel .
6	But its a trashy movie .
12	A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad .
20	I liked this better than Valley of the Dolls , which was not only trashy but boring as well .
7	At least this was not boring .
12	Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer .
18	Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable .
21	I am sure Pia 's a nice person in real life , she just does not project the writer vibe .
25	She looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from Saturday Night Fever and wearing a glittery disco dress .
8	A couple of the scenes are funny .
43	The one where she tells the two-timing actor that she 's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to " stop hanging around ! " , all the while he 's practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by .
8	Pia 's nervous breakdown scene is good .
34	It was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it ( the vortex of floating faces and freeze-frame scream - whoa ! ) and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone .
9	The acceptance speech is a hoot , though .
13	I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class .
12	But , again , this is trash we are talking about .
15	You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties .
14	Bad script , bad direction , over the top performances , overwrought dialogue .
7	What more could you ask for ?
13	For laughs , it just does not get any better than this .
24	Zadora 's over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the " Hollywood " machine .
18	Almost as funny as " Spinal Tap " even though it was clearly not intended as such .
17	Do not miss Ray Liotta 's debut film line , " Looks like a penis . "
23	Former professional boxer , Danish Carl Brisson , was given his start in films by Alfred Hitchcock in " The Ring " .
42	A very young Ian Hunter , who went on to have such a long career in movies , plays Bob Corby , who catches the eye of a pretty girl , Mabel ( Lillian Hall Davis ) at a fun fair .
26	She happens to be engaged to " One Round " Jack Sander ( Carl Brisson ) but that does not stop her flirting with Bob .
12	Bob is persuaded to go " one round " with Jack .
37	He goes several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if Jack is as good a fighter as they have heard .
36	He offers to take Jack on and Jack goes off , along with his boorish trainer ( the great Gordon Harker ) to make his fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he makes good .
27	Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day , but the deep attraction that she and Bob feel for each other is still there .
18	Jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight Bob for his wife .
39	At last a boxing movie where the hero does not go off the rails - Bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion - if only Mabel acted in the same way ! ! !
18	She has left him for Bob - and the fight at the end is a mighty one .
15	It is intensely realistic - it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film .
27	From being raw and enthusiastic , Jack is almost knocked out - then between rounds , reuniting with Mabel , gives him the courage to triumph .
32	The question is why would he even want her back - from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with Bob - why would not she do it again ?
7	The film is loaded with symbolism .
19	Jack , shaking hands with the promoter , changes to Mabel 's hands accepting a bracelet from Bob .
17	When Jack puts the ring on Mabel 's finger , Bobs bracelet slips down her arm .
23	At the end Jack sees Mabel 's reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on .
11	This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you .
3	Highly Recommended .
22	' One-Round ' Jack Sander is called that because he 's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience .
24	If they can last one round , they win a prize -- a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago .
30	Jack is in love with the ticket girl , Mabel , though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack .
29	What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ , so he 's able to beat Jack -- though it takes him some work .
19	As a result , Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit .
16	Later , Jack improves so much that he , too , becomes a legitimate boxer .
20	Slowly , he works his way up the rankings until he 's nearly ready to take on the Champ .
25	In the meantime , the Champ and Mabel start running around behind Jack 's back -- even though by now Mabel has married Jack .
24	So , when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob , it 's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him .
5	Is he good enough ?
12	Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance ?
5	Tune in and see .
48	This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films , back in the 1920s , Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote ( he did both for this film ) .
44	In fact , in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock 's silent style , as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents , THE MANXMAN ( also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband ) .
34	So , while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day , it was not a radical departure for this great director -- even with its rather formulaic ending .
22	Overall , while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly , the film works well .
18	While far from a perfect silent , it 's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch .
21	Another silent love triangle film from Hitchcock , not a mystery , but very English , very well-paced and photographed .
41	Smooth boxer Bob Corby ( Ian Hunter ) recruits circus boxer " One Round " Jack Sander ( Carl Brisson ) to be his sparring partner , partly to keep the pretty but fickle Mabel ( Lilian Hall-Davis ) nearby .
23	The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to her heart , or something like that .
27	It was another era altogether , with the audience in evening dress , and the boxers dressing up , too , when out of the ring .
21	The camera angles , the pace , the use of symbols , the cutting  all very stylish and masterful .
13	The camera-work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping .
38	Brisson 's good looks are well-used in this one ; his smiling is not so oblivious of what 's going on around him as he is in Hitchcock 's The Manxman , and so is not annoying .
7	But can boxers have such dimples ?
14	Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film .
23	The plot of the film , involving two boxers fighting over a girl , is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it .
15	Hitchcock 's talent , though , is found in his stunning use of images .
9	Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols .
19	Especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer .
26	He slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement Hitch has shown us all we need to know .
23	The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was .
12	The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women .
19	The object of the boxers ' desires is driven by money and lust , not reason or love .
28	The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships .
25	All in all , the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock 's early work and his development as a visual storyteller .
32	As an almost brand new director , there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career .
35	I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then , but I think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any Hitchcock film I have seen .
46	This kiss is never explained , and there is also the fact that , even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband , or at least ultimately chooses him , they look into each other 's eyes but do not actually kiss .
20	The film is certainly beautifully photographed , even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years .
32	There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack 's trainer who , in his stone faced expressionism , reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton .
18	Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous , but this is a great sample of his early work .
35	This early film has its flaws -- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance -- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock 's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images .
39	It 's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically ; note , for examples , the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery .
22	Its core , though , remains the final match , which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing .
38	The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should ; you can almost hear the ticking ( even though this is a silent film , the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them ) .
28	The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid , and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it .
19	The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight , a public domain company .
23	As with each Hitchcock silent they have released , they have attached various musical selections , mostly orchestral , to the action .
14	This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest .
19	It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films .
8	Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock .
18	One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself , this film shows remarkable story structure .
32	It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ " One Round " Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter .
24	The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack , his girl and the professional boxer .
24	The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men , this time for the heavyweight crown .
17	Even in this early film , Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement .
23	An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness .
24	The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 .
14	The final match , as a result , ends up being somewhat anticlimactic .
12	The story , though , is what carries this film through .
20	At first , I thought the Ring would be a more than normal movie with it 's ordinary plot .
5	How surprised was I !
38	Of course , the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter , with laughter and fear , with compassion and anguish .
10	The master did it great even before his thirties !
28	The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote himself and it deals , as many of his earliest pictures do , with a love triangle .
35	At first glance , it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity-themed morality comedies of Cecil B. De Mille , but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture .
28	Even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers , he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense .
26	As well as being a student of the German Expressionist style , the rhythmic editing style of Sergei Eisenstein had had its impact upon Hitchcock .
18	But here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery .
18	This is apparent from the opening shots , where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo .
40	And like Eisenstein , the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a split-second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in , we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring .
28	There is also a contrast , particularly with silent films from the US , in that The Ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards .
35	As much as possible is conveyed by imagery , and Hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip-read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters ' speech .
39	And it 's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting , it 's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing , particularly with point-of-view shots , as well as some strong yet subtle performances .
36	There are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices ( particularly double exposures ) , many of which were unnecessary , but there is far less of this than there is in The Lodger .
12	Let us make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors .
16	First up , the stunningly handsome and very talented Carl Brisson in the lead role .
35	In spite of his talent I was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role , as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist !
28	But that just goes to show how much I know , as it turns out Brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting .
27	Playing his rival is the competent Ian Hunter , who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s .
21	The most demanding role in The Ring has to be that given to Lillian Hall-Davis , torn between two lovers .
28	She pulls it off very well however with an emotive , understated performance , and it 's a shame her career never lasted in the sound era .
22	And last but not least the great Gordon Harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role .
16	The Ring 's climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent-era Hitchcock .
34	Martin Scorcese may have had his eye on The Ring when he directed the fight scenes in Raging Bull , as his watchword for these scenes was " Stay inside the ring " .
35	The fight in The Ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots , but when the action intensifies Hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it , with close-ups and point-of-view shots .
41	Hitchcock 's aim always seems to have been to involve his audience , and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character 's fear or paranoia .
15	The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger .
24	It 's a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture , and probably the best of all his silent features .
39	The symbolic use of objects , form editing , the position of characters in the scene ... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had .
38	Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see ; the boxing ring , the wedding ring , the bracelet the lover buys , and the love triangle at the heart of the story .
26	This movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space .
25	As a history of space flight , it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it .
18	Disney has shown it on " Vault Disney " and I wish they would do so again .
7	I have not seen this movie !
7	At least not in its entirety .
17	I have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all .
10	One sequence remains in my memory to this day .
16	A ( very convincing looking ) spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon .
16	The pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him .
18	The moon flashes into visability . . . . and for a few seconds there it is .
36	Parallel lines , squares , Could it be . . then the light fades and the brief glimse of ... what ... has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth .
2	Wonderful .
16	I have seen some other clips too but would LOVE to obtain the full movie .
15	This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it 's easy to see why .
14	Even 45 years later , it is quite an impressive piece of work .
14	Why it is not in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain .
10	Good use of live footage and animation in tandem .
35	This used to run as part of " Vault Disney " every few months or so , but I have not seen it listed in quite a while . * sigh * Most recommended .
19	Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994 .
15	But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the 80 's backwoods slasher .
29	The principle cast are all likable and it 's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away , which of course they do not .
46	There are one or two bad things about this movie , well not bad just minor , like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which does not go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the Deputy inability to follow logic .
26	There are not any sharp implements in SHALLOW GRAVE but , to my mind at least , it 's a slasher flick through and through .
19	The scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent Sheriff are tense and exciting .
25	All in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher , with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff .
40	Oh , where are you going , my little one , little one ... Turn around and you are two , turn around and you are four ... I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland .
16	I remember sitting there , electrified by Werner Van Braune 's explanations of rocket science .
18	I watched as history , science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities .
6	That was fifty years ago .
18	And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series , and what a treasure they are .
38	I watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter , who at first would not even come in the room , but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated .
21	As she watched I watched her , and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as I had been .
27	Turn around and you are a young wife with babes of your own ... Sure , some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong .
21	But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate , and the overall presentation is still impressive .
38	I found myself thinking my daughter 's teacher might want to show them to her class , not only as a 50 year old artifact , but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history .
23	Turn around , turn around , turn around and again ... you are wondering how much has really changed in 50 years .
33	Buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when " humanizing " animals , and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them .
33	Based on a true story , Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other , and that they will do anything for each other .
30	While not a perfect movie , the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children .
25	This film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets , but does show the difficulties .
12	A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions .
15	Trudy Lintz ( Rene Russo ) was one very fortunate lady many years ago .
15	She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money .
21	Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds .
14	Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children .
9	They dressed in clothes and had many amenities .
11	One day , she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla .
25	Knowing nothing about the large apes , she relies on her husband 's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla 's life .
21	Once out of danger , Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla , also , as one of her children .
21	This works well for years and Buddy , the gorilla , is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home .
16	But , Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous .
10	Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control ?
12	For those who love animals , Buddy is a must-see movie .
25	Based on a true story , Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore .
28	Of course , Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one , in the film , but he is very close to seeming totally real .
21	Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice .
22	The costumes are exemplary , as befitting the earlier era of the story , and the settings and production values outstanding .
30	But , most importantly , animals are here in abundance , not only Buddy , but the adorable chimps , the ducks , the rabbits , and so forth .
26	For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven , here on earth , this is a great movie choice .
25	All animal lovers , and even those who just want to watch a great family film , will go " ape " over Buddy .
29	EUROPA ( ZENTROPA ) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago .
12	This film is truly unique , and a work of genius .
29	The camerawork and the editing are brilliant , and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film , creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience .
22	The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed .
11	Max Von Sydow provides his great voice as the narrator .
7	A one of a kind movie !
7	Four stars ( highest rating ) .
26	I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst .
13	The gorilla looks just terrific , and the eyes were especially lifelike .
20	It 's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top .
8	Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine .
28	Usually these type of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla .
40	It 's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans , how they feel the same emotions we do , and yet how we really can not treat them just like people because they are not .
21	Not many films venture into this territory and it 's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity .
24	This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser .
22	Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser , and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson .
28	The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive .
13	After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife .
24	Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he 's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes .
17	The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story .
21	How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet do not do anything about it .
23	Since there was real no name actress in this picture I can not give it 10 weasel stars but I can give 8
18	This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense .
24	We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen .
18	Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them .
32	We know there will be dynamite in the car , that he will lose a wheel , that the car will have a crash , just to speak of the car .
6	And that is what happens .
16	Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film .
37	That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap .
12	Now , how is he going to get out of it ?
9	That 's what you must discover by yourself .
16	And do not worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story .
14	A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river .
11	We also know when he is going to be wounded .
12	They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days .
20	It 's true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq .
10	But what is the meaning of such a film ?
23	This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem .
33	But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil .
17	Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance ?
25	When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them , to do them .
11	It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive .
20	Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
41	This was the first " Walking Tall " movie I saw , I think in a $2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd . , so I did not have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker .
21	I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the " redneck gangs " .
29	I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he 's not going to let it slide , and went out to do something about it .
2	Courageous ?
15	I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine .
28	I think this movie is a great story about American courage to stand up and do something about a system that 's only serving its own interest .
25	The recent remake starring the " Rock " just does not do any justice to the real fire in the story of Buford Pusser .
15	A " classic " that I am sure will resurface again in the future .
33	All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a true hero , I only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him .
18	I would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave .
16	I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain .
7	My heart goes out to them .
29	And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford , I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him .
6	The story is extremely unique .
27	It 's about these 2 pilots saving Earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly .
19	The whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time , friends , and mentors .
7	The ending COULD have been fantastic .
29	It started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy Disney note and annoyed me VERY bad .
13	The animation is decent for 89 but can not compare to nowadays .
13	I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity .
9	I actually found it to be somewhat decent .
18	The nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess .
15	Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic .
25	Being an otaku since the days of Robotech , I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time .
13	Considering when it was made , the animation is of superior quality .
14	There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality .
22	Although the final episode is in black and white , it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film .
30	Although it has been described as being " sappy , " it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do .
35	Since the main character is a female , it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to " macho-man " tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers .
14	The seiryuu for Noriko , incidentally , also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2 .
38	Noriko is as 3-dimensional a cartoon can get ; her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will .
15	The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears .
39	Even the Gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious " Homing Laser " and " Buster Shield " ( which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true Dracula style ) technique .
16	I doubt that scene was meant to be funny , but it cracked me up .
18	Yet all in all , I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time .
8	Here 's a real weirdo for you .
31	It starts out with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower scene , on campus , then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for Spring Break .
16	The trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal Sheriff Dean .
23	One of the college cuties wanders into the woods , witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open .
21	Then it 's lets-rip-off MACON COUNTY LINE-time as Dean stalks , traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one .
11	Tony March is on-target as the evil , shotgun-happy Dean .
9	The movie 's overall tone is truly disturbing .
23	The ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film ; it 's also a study in despair .
15	SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes , misogynists and nihilists the world over .
10	This anime is a must-see for fans of Evangelion .
20	It 's an earlier work of Anno Hideaki , but his unrestrained , dramatic style is quite in place .
18	Also , those who did not like Evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable .
17	Gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it 's actually based on real science .
25	In fact , the show has several little " Science Lesson " interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie .
22	One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light .
38	The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an Earth where ten years have passed .
22	The main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably .
13	Be warned , this show is heavy on the sap at times .
18	It also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that I have ever seen .
38	I found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes , because the series is otherwise very good , but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one .
23	On an interesting note , Gainax , as always , managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes .
21	However , they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway .
27	The ending is a bit silly , but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut I could not help but love it .
16	Gunbuster is , in my opinion , one of the finest pieces of Anime around .
42	/ * slight spoilers * / Way back , before Evangelion was made , before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans , and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite , Gunbuster was made .
29	With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time , and the famous Otakon shorts or course , Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up .
24	It did not make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before , space opera .
19	Luckily , Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV ( direct to video ) series .
22	This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film .
23	This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long , with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way .
29	Besides that , they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam , and many other popular space operas .
20	For one , the shows starts out pretty light , with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting .
22	Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle , when she was still a little kid .
27	This makes her life at the academy quite hard , as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors .
24	The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama , with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school .
32	Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced , and Noriko and Kazumi ( best girl in class ) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out .
20	The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space , focusing on both personal drama and action .
18	A couple more characters are introduced , and parts of Noriko 's past are dragged up again .
24	Besides that , the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute , and the Gunbuster , mankind 's final hope , is presented .
21	Smart as writer Okada was , he incorporated the principles of time dilation , to spice things up a bit .
16	In short , time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light .
18	This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete .
29	Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated , when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base , who have aged considerably more than her .
49	The science might not be perfect , but it 's presented in a pretty believable way , with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes , where Noriko , Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series .
15	The animation , for a series made in the 80s , is definitely good .
16	The designs are retro 80s style of course , but it has it 's charm .
29	Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice , although the costumes do betray some of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest .
23	The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too , with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine , strong and vast .
11	The last episode was entirely done in black and white .
37	While it 's generally believed ( but not confirmed ) that this was done for budget reasons , it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series , which is suited perfectly for the latter part .
9	The music is very typical space opera fair .
14	Too bombastic in places , very generic , and definitely not worth buying .
19	It does fit the series for the most part , but it can become quite annoying at times .
22	Tanaka is not really a famous composer , and the only other respectable series he 's worked on is Dragon Half .
14	If you think 80s anime music , you will know what to expect .
30	As the series progresses , the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle , but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this .
19	Step by step the drama will be toned down , and the battles will take the front row .
9	Neither aspect is ever left completely out though .
17	While they are never answered later on , they still present some interesting food for thought .
28	The last episode is very epic , with a nice , but quite predictable ending , though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course .
7	Again , it fits the series .
33	Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first , with alien invasions , huge battles , and some personal drama , and for the bigger part , it is .
10	But it is done exceptionally well for a change .
30	Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements , six episodes long , Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism .
26	Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters , which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon .
18	The show is very tightly written , although it does tend to slip up at some points .
14	Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided .
20	Overall , the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed , sometimes sad , sometimes heroic one .
24	It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre , but at least it bend them a little .
13	Highly enjoyable anime classic , but not without flaws . *** / *****
5	Aim For The Top !
15	Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it .
17	I totally loved this series , and to this day , it remains my favorite anime .
18	And while it was not Gainax 's first animated product , it was their first OVA series .
17	It is because of her father 's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot .
17	But her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters .
17	Her friend , Kazumi Amano , even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot .
14	However , Noriko 's coach , Koichiro Ota , has faith in her .
34	And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot , for he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko 's father was killed .
47	Other characters include Jung-Freud , a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to , Smith Toren , a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together , and Kimiko Higuchi , Noriko 's childhood friend .
27	Kimiko 's involvement is also of interest , as while Noriko is off in space , Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life .
27	And because of the acts of time dilation , Kimiko ages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school .
20	By the end of the series , Noriko is roughly 18 years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties .
26	All in all , this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of Gainax animation .
26	If you like Hideaki Anno 's other shows , or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto 's artwork , then give this show a chance .
6	It will grow on you .
37	terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt , good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines , well acted and well cast , tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
10	Very entertaining , and a great cast as noted .
20	I 'd like to add that Bruce Dern did a fine job also , as is usually the case .
15	Worth renting if you can find it , which has proved difficult for me .
20	Also note that the Amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name .
11	Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon do the gambling world proud .
21	The various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself .
6	There are a few surprises .
28	AS cynical as we are today , I fully expected the ' good girl ' to be crying over his grave , instead of his Buddy 's .
22	Especially with her remarks about ' going to the funeral of her best friend ' , when she first meets Matt .
31	And then of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr. Allen 's face , blinding him ( interesting role by Bruce Dern ) .
31	WRRROOONNNNGGG ! ! ! some of the other Hollywood endings DO happen , but the writing is so excellent , the acting so carefully wrought that you are blissfully unaware .
9	And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD .
26	Taking us back to the 50s when our ' native passions ' were first being unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley .
32	Even a little racism raring its ugly head in Chicago , but at a club called , wonderfully , ' Biloxi ' with a Confederate flag backing up the racist remarks .
13	I will be watching it again , just to hear the music .
19	Good thing I have the FACTOTUM sound track , so I can listen to that in the car .
20	Watch both together , and you will see how Matt has matured .... playing bar room characters in both .
23	NOw that he owns a bar in the Paramount HOtel in NYC , he probably has great opportunity to do his studies .
9	Great actor , just coming into his own .
15	He shows finely nuanced performances ... the good and the bad in his characters .
22	His ' young boy off the farm ' is a great study , made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes .
8	He makes love , convincingly as well .
30	Since he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teen-ager , I wonder how that it ... making love to an actress you kinda grew up with .
8	Adds conviction , I will say that .
17	Considering the big name cast and lavish production I expected a lot more of this film .
22	The acting for the most part is great , although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best .
22	However the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent .
12	What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be .
14	This is the type of film that I have been looking for ages .
16	Particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking Chicago , which I still keep thinking about .
21	The back cover does not do this film justice , it 's superb , and in my top-5 for sure .
11	Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways .
49	First , it 's a fan made series , available only on the web , and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to , as Mickey & Judy once put it , put on a show .
12	It 's definitely friends & neighbors to , you can tell .
24	Still , you have to admit , for everything these friends & neighbors have put together , it 's actually fun to watch .
9	Yes , some of the dialogue is hokey .
2	Okay .
6	We can get by that .
2	Why ?
6	The graphics are first rate .
8	Better than almost anything you have seen .
20	And sometimes , a show or two really stands out story-wise  some of them are actually real tear-jerkers .
28	Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word  but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due .
15	It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude .
21	People , sets , costumes , graphics  it 's a huge effort on a lot of people 's parts .
11	We watch , we return , and we thank them .
25	Hidden Frontiers-is more than fan fiction - it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of Star Trek alive and growing .
29	From a fun little fan project to now a well known net series ; Hidden Frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it .
41	Set in the Late Star Trek : Next Generation/DS9 and Voyager time lines Hidden Frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series with set stories using a well developed characters , plots , and story arcs .
26	Done in a " Green Screen " studio ; Hidden Frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts .
20	The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project .
27	Inventive use of green screen technology , props , makes up and costumes work to make the Hidden Frontier worlds of Star Trek fun and believable .
23	Hidden Frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction , and thrived once they got there .
33	Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website , with interesting discussion forums , access to creative , production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat .
12	I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch .
11	Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break .
24	Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley , Georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods .
22	The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... " Shallow Grave " is a pleasant low-budget surprise .
19	The cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic .
8	Especially the second murder is pretty grim .
23	The murderous sheriff is not one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he 's done .
29	The subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10 .
8	This is short and to the point .
14	The story writing used for Star Trek : Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good .
23	Acting is all over the map , but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills .
25	It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-May 2007 .
15	I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics .
14	Considering this is all-volunteer , for no profit , it is pretty amazing .
26	If this was being ranked as a professional production , I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets .
33	However , as a fan-based production I have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts , this is in a league of its own .
13	For sheer volume , I do not think this has been matched .
13	Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire .
19	With the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast .
13	Nice starship CGI in places BUT their green screen needs some work .
17	Anyone heard of Adobe After Effects 7 , they should buy it get their keying better .
20	Stories are well thought out , plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context .
15	BUT BUT the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode .
21	Im not homophobic but i cant help that i do not find men kissing entertaining ( dont mind women ) .
11	Anyway ... For a fan series this is good stuff .
20	With minor improvement in their green screen , brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning .
13	Anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed TNG and DS9 .
39	Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was Gene Roddenberry 's mission .
28	Their focus on homosexuality , depression , war , and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other Trek series and movies .
38	The production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved , the stories are more complex , and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive .
20	In season 6 episode 1 , Countermeasures , there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek history .
14	The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting .
26	The real draw to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds , but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters .
18	There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know .
15	I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked !
23	I really enjoyed this one , and although the ending made me angry , I still give it 10 out of 10 .
46	Four college girls ( Baltron , Kelly , Stahl and Cadby ) are driving down to Florida , on their way they meet 2 guys ( Turner , Davis ) , they really add nothing to the plot , but are at least somewhat likable .
23	The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for some fun , but they have car problems and never make it .
23	One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help , the other three stay by the car .
28	Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom , being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes .
34	Soon she witnesses as a man ( March ) strangles a woman , in terror the girl flees the area , she does not get very far , but manages to get lost .
19	Eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested .
25	This is when I started getting mad , these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops do not believe them .
36	They are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell , the remaining friend manages to escape , but not without getting in dangerous situations .
22	This movie has nudity , good actresses , a shower scene imitating Psycho , graphic violence towards women and solid story .
28	Some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will NOT like the ending , but over all , this is a great little unknown movie .
42	I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more I have only started watching this film series last week and i just can not get enough of it .
18	I have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view .
19	I have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out .
29	I rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the staff of the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers on an excellent job .
17	If u like Star Trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film .
18	The detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
46	Okay , so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way , but from the beginning , Hidden Frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances , and have always been willing to mistakes they have made .
32	They advice people to see newer episodes first , so they can see just how good the show is , and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes .
11	The cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen .
31	The influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show , as the story lines go from strength to strength .
43	The show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression , drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way , but that is what Star Trek is and was all about .
19	It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way , dealing with them subtly and smoothly .
22	The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved .
42	They release bloopers for every episode , so the fans can see what a laugh they have , because they are people doing it in their spare time , with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock !
39	What this series , now drawing to a close after 7 years , has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together , inspiring others to do the same .
26	HF will live for a long time after it ends , as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place .
42	I kind of consider myself as the #1 fan of Hidden Frontier , seeing as I am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well , not counting conventions , of course .
27	I have been watching Hidden Frontier since 2001 , and I must say I continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with .
27	Hidden Frontier is the brainchild of Rob Caves and his self-made studio , Areakt Pictures , which operates out of the back room of his house .
41	The most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of Star Trek 's first openly gay character , Corey Aster ( who was introduced in the second season ) , and his search to find a soul mate .
18	Somewhere later in the series , he meets Jorian Zen , the Excelsior 's Trill helm officer .
44	Though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode , " Beachhead " , was just shown to HF fans in the chat room last night - I think that this relationship will endure , but only time will tell .
22	Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles .
24	Rob Caves created Hidden Frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is .
25	As the previous comment stated , I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10 , but it will have to suffice .
43	Although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by Star Trek : The Next Generation - I am willing to bet that we will hear much about Hidden Frontier after that final episode .
47	This is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans , and considering it 's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it 's story lines are complex and twisting , and it 's characters show realistic depth and dimension .
9	The CGI created by the crew is breathtaking .
23	While it 's first season might be a little shaky , it 's final few are well thought out and well shot .
33	Some fans might have thought that the Star Trek Franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of Enterprise , but these fans do not take no for an answer .
14	I recommend this to fans and newcomers alike , 10/10 hidden frontier crew .
4	Make it so ...
16	Nicely done , and along with " New voyages " it 's a great continuation !
16	Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode " Vigil " Check it out !
21	I like the growing characterisation , and think we have good replacements for the TV actors in a fan-produced piece .
15	For the record , I am not affiliated with the production in any way .
17	Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date .
18	Over 7 seasons ( this is the last ) they have produced some 50 or so episodes .
17	This is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy .
33	By their own admission , the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects , green screen work and acting all improve .
22	I did find it difficult to " dip into " so started from the beginning and watched all the way through .
26	HF benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the Star Trek universe in which it is set .
35	Characters and " relatives " from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories , sometimes improving on the characters over the original .
32	The whole experience includes an excellent web site , blooper reels , a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat .
19	If you are looking for high definition , high budget productions , this is probably not for you .
29	If you are looking for continued adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that does Star Trek credit and makes you think , this is the one .
31	Star Trek : Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet only fan film , done completely for the love of the series , and a must watch for fans of Trek .
23	The production quality is extremely high for a fan film , although sometimes you can tell that they are green-screenin ' it .
11	This does not take away from the overall experience however .
36	The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here , and , as a whole , I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9 .
15	Hidden Frontier is a fan made show , in the world of Star Trek .
12	The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta-quadrant .
21	It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows , but most of them are original to the show .
28	The show takes place on the star base Deep Space 12 and on several space ships , which gives it opportunities the official shows do not have .
24	The characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy , which characters in shows with only one ship does not have .
29	The show has good computer animation of spaceships , but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors .
13	Not all the actors are equally good , but most do fine .
13	The episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes .
18	That is a bit more like in Babylon 5 , than in most official Star Trek shows .
14	Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using .
8	All in all I enjoyed watching it .
15	Hidden Frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based Star Trek fan series .
37	While the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like Starship Exeter , or New Voyages , Hidden Frontier concentrates largely on story , and in that regard it does very well indeed .
21	Hidden Frontier has no physical sets ; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen , and the backgrounds inserted digitally .
17	One of Hidden Frontier 's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced .
26	One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming , instead of in post-production .
42	While this does save a great deal of time , it 's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production , though it still serves its purpose .
45	While it may not be everyone 's cup of tea , Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot , though you might be best to start off watching the third season , since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride .
28	Low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star , becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much .
22	Good cast and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here before .
16	Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice sounds a lot like Mini Mouse !
16	She disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitated art !
18	A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born though .
18	I agree with all the accolades , I went through a box of tissues watching this film .
12	It had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way .
17	The question I am about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals .
34	I had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats , and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was hideous .
33	This is the age of " no animals were hurt in the production of this move . " Iphigenia was made in the late 70 's before the advent of computer simulation .
9	Was it possible to fake these animal deaths ?
8	Or were these animals slaughtered for art ?
28	I acquired this , one of my all-time favourite films on DVD recently and as usual , during viewing , the whole thing just blew me away .
28	I am a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears , especially the " Will You " track .
13	It 's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth .
14	This rates second best to Quadrophenia ( which also starred Phil Daniels ) .
24	A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80 's in which I grew up .
21	The ending is so sad , for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby .
30	I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing , I can watch it over and over again and never be bored , simply for the soundtrack alone .
10	Hazel , sorry to hear about your dad darling .
6	God Bless you all . xx
28	Anyone interested in pop music , and not familiar with British music trends of the late-seventies , should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once .
29	The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled ( there really has been nothing new since 1980 ) .
27	This was a dazzling time , and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape , and does both extremely well .
35	I first saw " Breaking Glass " when it was released in England in 1980..I loved it then and having just caught it in August 2005 on a Canadian station it still is great .
40	The only thing I regret is I can not find the sound track or the DVD in the stores ? ? ... anyone care to shed some light or must I order it from some over priced internet company .
15	Please if you get the chance watch this movie you will not be sorry !
24	I first saw " Breaking Glass " in 1980 , and thought that it would be one of the " Movie Classics " .
17	This film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers .
24	This is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry .
12	I can not wait for it to be available on DVD .
20	Breaking Glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once .
32	It is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible .
30	Looking at some of today 's ' search for a star ' style TV shows on both in the UK and abroad I am always reminded of this film .
28	Though not an expert on the subject , the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there .
12	This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same .
35	After getting rid of her manager , played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels , slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out .
13	You potential stars of tomorrow .... WATCH THIS AND BEWARE ! ! !
18	I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out .
34	It blew my little head away , I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I 'd heard , having been a strictly folky , classical kid growing up .
30	The music mesmerized me , as did Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances , and Phil Daniels ' tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart .
15	But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce 's drugged out sax player .
21	He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic , he just begged for sympathy .
19	Favorite scenes , the performance when the lights went out , and the love scene on the train .
10	Okay , so the movie is not the Rose !
37	But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80 's , exploding with rebellious youth , looking for a way out of the dole queue .
29	I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there .
10	If you get a chance to , see it .
19	It is a great movie , with some wonderful performances , and the music will blow you away .
29	At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing ( I really started to LOVE Le Carre after that novel ) .
34	The main character is not wavering at all : he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love , or is he not ?
30	There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in ' the service ' , or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case .
36	The BBC has done a superb work with these series from LeCarre 's novels : the actors are excellent , as are the locations and sets ; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted .
18	Be warned though , even if someone may find it laughable , the after taste IS bitter .
11	I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD .
9	The acting throughout is excellent - no question .
12	There was not quite enough action for me I must say .
14	No real suspense as such , just plenty of first class character development .
11	Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of " whodunnit " .
16	If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you .
10	Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent .
9	The film portrayed the life of a traitor .
35	A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things .
24	As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man .
25	Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him ( wife , son , mentor ) .
18	Pym is fatally damaged by his father 's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away .
10	He has no real love or loyalty in him .
14	Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series .
5	Very well done though .
43	Having just seen the A Perfect Spy mini series in one go , one can do nothing but doff one 's hat - a pure masterpiece , which compared to the other Le Carré minis about Smiley , has quite different qualities .
32	In the minis about Smiley , it is Alex Guiness , as Smiley , who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him , one can say .
31	Here it is ensemble and story that 's important , as the lead actor , played excellently by Peter Egan in the final episodes , is not charismatic at all .
35	Egan just plays a guy called Magnus Pym , who by lying , being devious and telling people what they like to hear , is very well liked by everyone , big and small .
17	The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex , his Czech handler .
17	Never have the machinery behind a spy , and / or traitor , been told better !
27	After having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor .
25	His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into ' a perfect spy ' , as his Czech handler calls him .
31	And , by following his life , we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path , once you have veered off it .
23	He trundles on , even if he never get anything economic out of it , except promotion by his MI5 spy masters .
14	Everyone 's happy , as long as the flow of faked information continues !
28	Magnus 's father , played wonderfully by Ray McAnally , is a no-good con-man , who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money .
18	In later years it is his son who has to bail him out , again and again .
50	But by the example set by his dad and uncle , who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison , and his mom is sent off to an asylum , Magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving , not telling the truth .
44	At first he overdoes it a bit , but quickly learn to tell the right lies , and to be constant , not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad .
37	The young lads who play Magnus in younger years does it wonderfully , and most of them are more charismatic than the older , little more cynic , and tired , Pym , played by Egan .
26	But you buy the difference easily , as that is often the way we change through life , from enthusiasm to sorrow , or indifference .
6	Indeed well worth the money !
25	As a fan of author John le Carre I have slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them .
28	I found this 1987 adaptation of le Carre 's masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking I would know what to expect .
26	I was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries , a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama .
17	Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym , the perfect spy of the title .
22	Carrying on in the long tradition of le Carre 's strong main characters , Pym is also quite possibly the best .
49	Egan plays Pym ( who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre ) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming " a perfect spy " .
21	Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run , if not from others then from himself .
18	Egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone .
8	Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast .
33	Ray McAnally gives one of his finest performances as Pym 's con man father Rick who ( as le Carre has said ) is based strongly on the author 's own father .
29	McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of Pym 's life and is one of the those responsible for Pym becoming " a perfect spy " .
31	In fact if it was not for McAnally 's performance a year after this in A Very British Coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career .
10	The rest of the supporting is excellent as well .
38	From Caroline John as Pym 's mother to Alan Howard as his spy mentor to Rüdiger Weigang as the young Pym 's friend turned controller to Jane Booker as Pym 's wife the supporting cast is fantastic .
42	Special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger Pym ( Jonathan Haley , Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor ) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well By Peter Egan .
11	The production values of the miniseries are strong as well .
27	As the miniseries adaptations of Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy and Smiley 's People proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format .
26	The locations are excellent from the English locations to the those scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA as are the sets by Chris Edwards .
18	The cinematography of Elmer Cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries .
11	Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script .
17	Screenwrtier Arthur Hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently .
28	The novel was largely ( at least in its early parts ) autobiographical in that Pym 's early life echoed much of John le Carre 's life .
26	The script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from young boy to " a perfect spy " .
24	Never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage .
36	If one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight , fist fight , or James Bond style car chase this would be the proof .
21	While the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it .
23	Though it might be overlong for some for those who do not have very short attention spans here is a must see .
33	From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to fine production values and a fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see .
19	It is a fascinating trip down the history of the Cold War yet it is more then that .
33	It is also a trip down what John le Carre has called " the secret path " : the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive .
18	As much a human drama as a spy thriller A Perfect Spy is not to be missed .
11	This is my second time through for A Perfect Spy .
12	I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it .
5	I like it still .
23	It 's natural that it gets compared to the beeb 's other big Le Carre ' series , Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy .
27	Tinker Tailor focuses on the " game " spies play ; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person a spy is .
18	There are a number of themes that these movies share , along with others in the genre .
26	Ambiguity - moral , sexual , interpersonal - which creates a multidimensional space of true vs. false , inside vs. outside , love vs. responsibility .
31	In a way , these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect - " backstabbed " in its various nuances .
10	The theme of fathers and father-figures is also important .
22	One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick , the main character Magnus ' perhaps ersatz father .
9	Throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed .
7	Another theme is that of malignancy .
30	The nature of the business is to turn others - turn them against their government , against their friends and associates , turn them against their values and beliefs .
50	In each of the Le Carre ' movies I have seen , The Spy who Came in From the Cold , Looking Glass War , Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , Smiley 's People , and A Perfect Spy , turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy .
34	Finally , not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot , or perhaps two shots bookending the story .
12	Violence , torture , cruelty are always just beneath the surface .
35	We see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects Le Carre '' s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass .
23	If you have not seen the films above , and you enjoy A Perfect Spy , you are in for a treat .
30	I 'd also recommend The Sandbagger series ( Yorkshire TV ) , the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity .
14	The IPCRESS File and Burial in Berlin are nice , though light weight .
22	For political intrigue try A Very British Coup , House of Cards and Yes , Minister / Yes , Prime Minister .
24	If only a brit would set his hand to making The Three Kingdoms - there would be a film with intrigue and complexity .
35	This is an extremely long movie , which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting , but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies .
33	If you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching , because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak .
44	If you can love a monster you will cry for Magnus Pym , the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country , his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people .
24	There is not one truly likeable character in the entire story , not one loyal , ' moral ' personality to sympathise with .
16	But watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable .
8	I really enjoyed it in the end .
14	Well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character .
27	It 's been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time .
26	Most of the components of ' A Perfect Spy ' , the adaptation of LeCarré 's finest novel , in my opinion , are top-drawer .
43	Outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay , the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also , I believe , the screenwriter for ' Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy ' with Alec Guinness a few years before .
23	The actors are mostly very good , some superb , like Alan Howard 's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally 's Ricky Pym .
15	Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle .
19	The passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done .
18	So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming .
39	The only jolt comes after the character of Magnus Pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a noticeably too-old Peter Egan , just fresh out of Oxford .
12	But this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole .
24	Egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be " upset " emotionally , ie cry .
35	None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments , aside from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all she 's worth and steals the episode with ease .
8	Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym .
30	She has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife , which Mary Pym is .
13	Rüdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel , amusing , ironic and brilliant .
12	I also enjoyed Sarah Badel 's camp turn as the Baroness .
14	The British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes .
8	The humor and sadness are subtly blended .
27	LeCarré has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy , yet wistful , atmosphere of the original .
25	Not a perfect production ( what is ? ) and yet the best of the LeCarré adaptations to reach film or television to date .
11	Highly recommended to all spy-thriller lovers and especially LeCarré fans .
5	DVD available from Acorn .
28	This is without doubt my favourite Le Carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for .
22	I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but I believe this misses the point .
14	All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception .
14	It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set .
12	Betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody .
15	Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it chilling watching .
17	Peter Egan is in his finest role and the late lamented Ray McAnally is unbelievably good .
22	Even the smallest roles played by such as Andy de la Tour , Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are spot on .
9	This cast is a Theatre Impresario 's Dream .
32	The Story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason .
19	Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre , exquisitely transformed into a classic film .
15	Even the small parts , such as Major Membury , are performed to perfection .
28	I have read the book at least a dozen times , and watched the movie almost as many times , and continue to be mesmerized by both .
23	If I had one book to take on a desert island , A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others .
21	Erotic cinema of the 1970 's was tame compared to the triple X romps of today , which is good .
14	Because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes .
32	Of course , I wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little .
34	Plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods , but it 's worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled THE DEVIL 'S PLAYTHING .
25	But if you do not care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex , then this is not the movie for you .
12	However , I did enjoy it and I give it...7 STARS .
2	Spoilers !
6	Classic 70 's sex trash !
14	The Swedish gal ( Helga ) was what made this movie so great .
16	She was beautiful , but what really got to me was how sexual she was .
10	She exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film .
13	Her best scenes were when she was , er , stimulating herself .
10	Whenever she was on screen , I became transfixed .
21	Also , the Doctor Julia ( sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film ) was very interesting visually .
42	Although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than Julia , she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes ( especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt ) also grabbed my attention unmercilessly .
35	You also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid ; I do not know if I have ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time .
3	Classic stuff !
35	Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name , including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire The Day the Fish Came Out .
8	Iphigenia , however , is a highlight .
37	Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play by Euripides , it 's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States courtesy the Flix Channel .
42	Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding , but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen , blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game .
8	Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema .
17	Well , if you are looking for a great mind control movie , this is it .
15	No movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control , and naked .
25	Marie Forsa , as the busty Helga , is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she is not .
10	One wishes they made more movies like this one .
35	Well the story is a little hard to follow the first time , but that 's only because of all the bare breasted ' 70s painted-up vampire / witches dancing to the bongo drums .
10	This of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies .
12	And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them .
18	And for girl on girl action , vampiric or not ... this movie just rocks ! ! !
13	This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master Joseph W. Sarno .
19	It features plenty of soft core sex , really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women .
14	The acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well-made .
25	Marie Forsa is one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen in a horror movie-it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body .
11	Sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies .
8	A must see for fans of sexploitation !
45	THE DEVIL 'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS , it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste .
26	This one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle , that want to resurrect their previously murdered " leader " .
31	In order to do so , the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood , too .
32	Lots of nudity - including some full-frontal , some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course , lesbo-bloodsucking ... but these scenes are still pretty tame by today 's standards .
27	Some pretty hot women in this one , would have benefited from some more explicit sex , but I guess ya can not have it all .
38	Also would have benefited from some heavier violence / gore , being that it IS a vampire film , but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL 'S PLAYTHING was more to showcase skin , not blood .
32	Still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that 's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget .
20	Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking . 7/10
6	This is an excellent show !
15	I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this .
29	There are many " facts " in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl points them out very well , in a way that is unforgettable .
48	Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students .
13	Use of live actors performing " skits " is also very entertaining .
21	I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down .
15	this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen .
28	This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16 . this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning .
48	I do not know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance .
35	If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it .
12	I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series .
6	It would have an amazing following
12	I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before seeing this .
13	But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is .
23	This HBO special features him teaching " American history " to New York university film students and the man was just phenomenal .
24	He poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the U.S. but some other parts of the world .
25	This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me question if what I accept as the infallible true history is really true .
21	I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting .
20	I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his / her beliefs .
35	I recently watched this , but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about , what the topic was ..... in short - I had no idea what it was .
17	Was it a documentary , was it a comedy routine ..... Well , it was BOTH .
25	It started a little slow , but I think that 's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing .
7	But it quickly sucked me in .
14	The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history .
25	Mainly how we ( american 's ) learn history that is not really true - and how we got to learn what we did .
18	He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained , and interested .
22	I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be .
14	I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO .
33	I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are " taught " in the same type of manner as this episode .
19	Robert Wuhl is teaching a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan , New York .
14	He covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known .
11	I would like to see much more of this show .
5	It is very entertaining .
16	Mr. Wuhl uses examples and " show and tell " to get his points across .
19	He explained that the person who actually rode the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere was not Paul Revere !
12	Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere 's name because it sounded better .
30	I have watched Robert Wuhl for many years , from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way through " Arli $ $ " on HBO .
18	He 's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian , but he 's an excellent teacher !
12	I highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show .
7	It is well worth your time .
6	Will Tarzan stand for that ?
32	This film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving Tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer 's interest and does not let up .
33	The cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and should not be taken so seriously .
22	Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect ?
26	Well , unfortunately " Convention City " is lost , so well just have to watch " Tarzan and His Mate " to find out .
16	For 1934 , there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh .
8	Just look at Jane 's nude swim .
29	While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else , this picture proves that the series was originally very adult .
18	Over seventy years later , it is still as sexy as it was when it came out .
18	In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature , it is a superb and exciting adventure story .
49	I have always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s , but there are few from the genre I 'd call great films . " Tarzan and His Mate " is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre .
20	The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today .
16	Also , the animals are all too cool ( espescially the apes throwing boulders ) .
22	The acting will not win any major awards soon , but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture .
16	The film is once again stolen by Cheetah , the smartest monkey in the jungle .
12	One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there .
15	My interest was raised as I was flipping through and saw the name Iphigenia .
15	My name is Eugenia so I thought OK , lets see what this is .
10	I am so glad I stayed on the channel .
7	What a wonderful , wonderful story .
17	Drama , sadness , some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had .
26	I watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over .
17	Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did .
19	I have even gotten my children ( 27 , 25 , 20 and 17 ) to enjoy it .
19	It starts slow , however , the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story .
17	Watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more Greek tragedy and pathos .
23	Make no mistake , Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most gorgeous Jane ever , and there will never be one more gorgeous .
5	She is visually stunning .
16	That aside , it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film .
6	This is a great film .
18	It not only has the classic Tarzan aura , but also the feel of the continuing saga .
43	We become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory , one of them in love with Jane , the other , a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history .
16	And these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic .
9	There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted .
30	However , the Africans are depicted as individuals , and at the end , two even become more heroic than the white hunters , and stand out as such .
19	In fact , the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters .
15	The finale , also , is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie .
31	The great lion attack has never been duplicated , and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction .
25	If I left anything out , it is because I do not want to soil the picture for those who have not seen it .
11	But it is everything you could want in a movie .
18	I only saw IPHIGENIA once , almost 30 years ago , but it has haunted me since .
24	One sequence particularly stays in mind , and could only have been fashioned by a great director , as Michael Cacoyanis undoubtedly is .
21	The context : the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on King Agamemnon 's shoulders .
16	An act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas , endangering his great expedition to Troy .
25	He is told he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the Thousand Ships .
33	He initially resists , but comes around , and tricks his wife Clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the Greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors , Achilles .
21	Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive , find out about the sacrifice , and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance .
19	Meanwhile , the proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent , dishonorable way .
13	He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her .
18	The shot : The camera circles the two young people , without looking directly at each other .
20	They bemoan their fate , and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war .
49	Suddenly , they gaze at each other and , for one moment , we feel both their power and beauty , and the unstated -- except by the camera -- irony that in another time , another place , they perhaps could love each other and be married .
14	It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant .
3	What direction !
3	What camera !
3	What storytelling !
22	Tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) was the only Tarzan movie I did not see when I was a kid .
4	It sounded boring .
6	Now I have seen it .
22	I have seen the ape man ( 1932 ) about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive .
6	It 's a remarkable movie .
5	It 's almost flawless .
11	Tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) however , falters .
17	It 's not harmonic and it 's parts tend to live a life of there own .
14	The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great .
4	Big budget expensive .
5	Tarzan himself is co-starring .
3	Jane dominates .
23	She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead .
2	Well .
20	She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant .
13	She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father .
2	Forever .
17	The thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle .
2	Stupid ?
8	Later someone founds it in the river .
10	Well it 's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead .
4	Some cheap drama .
18	The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that he is gone .
17	She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away ( to England ) .
18	Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is , how hard he is to kill .
9	The caravan is leaving and Jane go along .
4	Again a pothole .
31	She could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more , to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband .
5	She could be smart .
16	She could dive where they found the floating bracelet , check the banks for traces .
13	She can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in Liana 's .
12	Picking up traces should not be too hard for jungle Jane .
11	She could talk to the apes , and so on .
15	If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable .
10	Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down .
23	And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with " I blame myself as much as you " .
7	A punishment for being vane perhaps ?
2	Nonsense .
12	Struggle , a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate .
2	Still .
16	This movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep .
6	Just lean back and enjoy .
9	It 's Tarzan and Jane for God sake .
16	108 : Tarzan and His Mate ( 1934 ) - released 4/20/1934 , viewed 8/6/08 .
12	John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in Iowa .
10	Bonnie & Clyde kill two highway patrolman in Texas .
14	BIRTHS : Ralph Nader , Gloria Steinem , Alan Arkin , Richard Chamberlain .
43	DOUG : After we were rather disappointed with the original ' Tarzan the Ape Man , ' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film , ' Tarzan and his Mate , ' was the best in the series .
4	It 's true .
10	I got a huge kick out of this movie .
41	Johnny Weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging , animal dueling wild super-hero , and Maureen O'Sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love Jane ( who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here ) .
34	In my review for ' Ape Man , ' I stomped on Jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming , but she 's redeemed herself for me here .
24	Make no mistake : O'Sullivan is the star of this movie , and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast .
43	She acts as the ambassador between Holt and Tarzan , she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals , and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she 's out of bullets .
10	She 's even got her own jungle scream now .
9	The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible .
7	She 's totally got him trained .
15	Cheeta is quite charming as well , taking drags off of Martin 's cigarette .
27	The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to do battle with the jungle 's most vicious animals , especially lions , crocodiles , and rhinos .
19	The effects , though always visible , are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely .
18	Oh , and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene .
12	All I can say is : yes , she is naked .
4	Very exciting stuff .
4	KEVIN : Wow .
3	Just wow .
40	When it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action / adventure , nothing holds a candle to ' Tarzan and His Mate . ' The inevitable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a kick-ass , violent and risqué jungle epic .
21	I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does .
25	You 'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be Code-approved , or Animal Rights-approved for that matter .
27	The gruesome violence does not even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today 's adventure movies .
21	And after T & J enter the picture , there is plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims .
11	See it for yourself if you do not believe me .
11	I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this film .
29	In the first film , Jane seemed like a walking contradiction , like the writers back then just did not know how to portray a character like that .
14	But here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema .
28	Although she still requires Tarzan 's assistance in getting her out of most jams , she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued .
23	Her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living ( relatively ) comfortably in the jungle for a year .
30	I watched this with my Mom , and I enjoyed pointing out to her just how much Jane has Tarzan " trained , " as Jeff Foxworthy put it .
13	She totally has the ape man at her every beck and call .
32	Although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film , there is still plenty of hair-raising Tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed ( mostly ) for real .
43	That and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around . ** SPOILER ** The film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two humans still breathing .
16	Other than that , this is pre-Code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed .
11	Last film : It Happened One Night ( 1934 ) .
9	Next film : Twentieth Century ( 1934 ) .
39	A year after losing gorgeous Jane Parker ( Maureen O'Sullivan ) to love rival Tarzan , hunter Harry Holt ( Neil Hamilton ) returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe 's heart .
29	Mixing business with pleasure , he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the Mutia escarpment , Tarzan 's stomping ground .
28	Nasty Arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile .
48	Of course , Tarzan is not dead  only wounded ; after being nursed back to health by Cheetah ( ! ) , he swings back into action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked Holt 's expedition .
39	Cheetah also has his fair share of excitement , dodging rhinos , crocs , and big cats , riding on Tarzan 's back as he crosses a river , and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride .
22	If anything , they make it even more fun ! 8.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 9 for IMDb .
19	One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action packed ( and graphic ) .
34	Picking up a year or so after Tarzan the Ape Man , Niel Hamilton 's Holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory .
20	His Friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan .
23	Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition .
17	When they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded .
25	They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire .
15	Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures .
21	Its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for TV .
30	As it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic , touching , action filled and everything else that a movie should be .
9	Its an amazing film by almost any standard .
5	Its an amazing thing .
9	I really like this film a great deal .
19	If there are any flaws to the film , its perhaps that the film has not aged well .
30	The rear screen is often very obvious , there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing .
12	However on almost every other level this film is top notch .
10	You really owe it to yourself to see this .
24	Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time .
8	This is one of the great adventures .
22	I have the entire Weissmuller Tarzan series on DVD ( fully restored editions ) & I never tire of watching them .
38	My personal favorite is " Tarzan and His Mate " , due entirely ( well almost entirely ) to Maureen O'Sullivan's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front .
47	Oh ... One final word about nudity ... at the very beginning , while the white hunters are speaking dialogue , keep your eyes on the background extras ... there are several good shots of nude African girls ( obviously shot on location ) behind them .
35	One more thing , the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930 's until the 1960 's ... that 's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then .
27	Shaft had not even been thought about at that time , nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history .
29	Safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads ... and Tiny 's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and Jane .
39	As a matter of fact , it was not until Gene Autry treated the native Americans and colored people in his Westerns like real human beings that Hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so .
31	Hard to believe , perhaps , but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose Hayes Code .
23	Yes indeed , priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin .
7	I am not making this up .
14	They had several reasons , as follows : Item : Jane likes sex .
14	She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter .
38	She stretches sensuously , and with a coquettish look she says " Tarzan , you have been a bad boy ! " So they have not only been having sex , they have been having kinky sex !
25	A few years later , under the Hays Code , people ( especially women ) were not supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex .
27	Item : Jane prefers a guileless , if wise and resourceful , savage ( Tarzan ) to a civilized , respectable nine-to-five man ( Holt ) .
40	When Holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from London , she wavers a bit ; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan , and Holt and Jane both believe he 's dead , she wavers a lot .
19	But when she realizes her man is very much alive , the attractions of civilization vanish for her .
4	And why not ?
32	Tarzan 's and Jane 's relationship is egalitarian : He lacks the " civilized " insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as " the head of his wife " .
16	To boot , he lacks many more " civilized " hangups , for example jealousy .
24	When Holt and his buddy arrive , Tarzan greets them both cordially , knowing perfectly well that Holt is Jane 's old flame .
32	When Holt gets her dolled up in a London dress and is slow-dancing with her to a portable phonograph , Tarzan drops out of a tree , and draws his knife .
2	Jealous ?
2	Nope .
18	He 's merely cautious toward the weird music machine , since he 's never seen one before .
9	Once it 's explained , he 's cool .
8	Item : Civilized Holt is dirty minded .
6	Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy .
24	As Jane slips into Holt 's lamplit tent , Holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress .
15	Where is the " universal prurience " so dear to the hearts of seminarians ?
6	Nowhere , that 's where .
12	Another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful .
29	Item : The notion that man is the crown of creation , and animals are here only for man 's use and comfort , takes a severe beating .
26	Holt and his buddy want to be guided to the " elephant graveyard " so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home .
10	They want Tarzan to guide them to said graveyard .
16	You , reader , are thinking " Fat chance ! " and you are right .
4	He 's shocked .
13	He exclaims " Elephants sleep ! " which to him explains everything .
15	Jane explains Tarzan 's feelings , which the two " gentlemen " find ridiculous .
20	Item : Jane , the ex-civilized woman , is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies .
17	Holt and buddy blow it , and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals .
8	It is Jane who maintains her cool .
19	While the boys panic , she takes charge , barks orders at them and passes out the rifles .
49	Of course , Tarzan , who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends , comes to the rescue , routs the white hunters , and induces the pack elephants and African bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came .
3	The End .
6	So there you have it .
5	An utterly subversive film .
21	The joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by Jane 's soprano version of the famous Tarzan yell .
12	A nice touch , which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions .
14	Let us hear it for artistic freedom , feminist Jane , and sex .
10	Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle .
14	Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization .
9	But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave .
24	One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means killing Tarzan .
36	This is a rarity -- a sequel that 's better than the original . " Tarzan , the Ape Man " of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged .
13	This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult .
28	There is tons of blatant racism ( a black man is shot to death point blank -- and no one really cares ) but this was 1934 .
29	There is also plenty of blood , gore and violence ( for a 1934 movie ) and uncut prints have Jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude !
32	There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing and ( it 's implied ) they sleep together and have sex -- without being married .
14	This would not bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme .
17	That aside , the movie is well-directed , very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement .
23	Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane 's outfit is pretty revealing too .
16	I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan .
5	Everybody else is OK .
12	This is easily the best Weismuller -- O'Hara Tarzan out there .
8	WELL worth seeing but not for kids !
10	The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller .
14	The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again .
16	Just know that The actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for the role .
28	If you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day Tarzan films as a reference . . you are missing a Real treat .
29	Does not matter how far we have come in movie making , makeup set designs ... no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did .
6	He was and is Tarzan .
27	In the opinion of several of my friends and family members , including myself , this is the finest of the entire gamut of Tarzan movies .
16	Johnny Weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series .
13	It definitely rates a " 10 " in my collection of films .
13	A very interesting entertainment , with the charm of the old movies .
22	Tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it , and we all enjoy with him his success .
33	The most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills ( he was a great swimmer and had a great shout )
31	Although the recent re-telling of part of Homer 's epic " Troy " with Brad Pitt was entertaining once , " Iphigenia " with the incandescent Irene Pappas is breathtaking .
16	Unfolding in a natural setting with Greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity .
24	A chance encounter with this film on one of DirecTV 's many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems .
35	There is no glitter or " bling " in this movie , just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil .
17	I think even Homer , if he really existed , would be proud of this telling .
1	JLH
18	This splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed Tarzan series put out by MGM .
32	It is a first-class adventure for many reasons , I suggest -- fine photography , strong imaginative qualities , a delightful cast , good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline .
37	Johnny Weissmuller plays Tarzan , a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike Edgar Rice Burroughs ' creation ; but he is honest , loyal , brave and very courageous , and he needs to be during this narrative .
36	As Jane Parker , his wife who had been Jane Porter in the novels , Maureen O'Sullivan is very attractive and lively , as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality .
15	The effect of the lighting , the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual .
14	This is an outdoor adventure filmed on the MGM back-lot which really works .
46	The fabulous Mutir Escarpment is a remote locale which allows Tarzan and Jane to live undisturbed ; but into their idyll come people searching from them , emissaries of a civilization Jane has left behind and into which Tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated .
39	One is Harry Holt , still in love with her , who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him ; the gown and perfumes interest her , but she refuses to leave Tarzan .
20	Tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals , in scenes that look like a humanized King King .
46	The group claim to want to hunt animals , and Tarzan agrees for Jane 's sake to a bit of big game trapping ; but at some point , the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition 's heads ' minds .
34	Tarzan is shot , left for dead ; and the group force Jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous " elephant 's graveyard " .
16	But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions .
15	The film was directed by set-design wizard Cedric Gibbons , and quite beautifully too .
31	His work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film , which manages to seem real despite all its Hollywood shortcomings from start to finish .
24	Neil Hamilton is a very good Harry , Paul Cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad .
13	Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry round out a small cast very professionally .
17	An unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well .
2	Recommended .
27	This was the second of the series of 6 " classic Tarzan " movies featuring Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane .
42	As usual , this was a wonderful film in this series ; and perhaps stands out as an " in between " film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s .
16	As such , it displayed good pace , though not as good as subsequent films .
15	Likewise , the cinematography is less accomplished than later Tarzan films in this series .
20	The stock I saw was of uneven quality , containing some grainy scenery and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes .
11	The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here .
24	Regarding plot , one interesting feature here was Jane 's near-fickleness and inconstancy , when she was being subject to Martin 's flirtations .
30	The kiss  and Jane 's stunned , and partly guilty , reaction  foreshadow something of the Jane we see in the future as well in these films .
11	Compare , for example , in Tarzan Finds a Son !
13	Jane 's duplicitous actions tricking Tarzan and delivering Boy to his family .
10	Later she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong .
48	Here , nothing quite so explicit , but we have Jane " returning " to the Jane Parker of yesteryear , and in an almost repentant series of actions , stripping herself of the evening gown brought by Martin and Harry to entice her away from Tarzan .
17	There were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing .
34	For one thing , the picture we get of the domestic life of Tarzan is here , as later , a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death .
14	This to me is very much at the core of the Tarzan experience .
15	I was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today 's standards .
19	The final battle scenes of savages & lions on the ground and savages & apes in the trees .
32	Jane , showing us that she is truly of Tarzan 's world now , quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away .
35	The final series of scenes is splendid : suddenly Tarzan is on the scene , flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions , and summoning the elephants to the rescue !
42	That final cry of Tarzan in triumph , holding a happy Jane in his arms , with a dancing and delighted Cheetah beside them , is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of Tarzan and Jane .
12	All in all , this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie .
9	I would recommend this movie strongly to anyone .
30	" Tarzan and His Mate " , the second of MGM 's Tarzan pictures , picks up a year after the events of " Tarzan the Ape Man " .
46	Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle , and Harry Holt ( one of the expeditioners in the first film ) returns , this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable Martin Arlington , in quest of the ivory from the elephants ' graveyard .
15	Naturally , a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way .
21	The first film romanticized everything -- the jungle , adventure , romance itself , wild animals , and even death .
27	The second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences , but a more serious tone underlies the action .
15	The characters dare to ask questions like : What if something happened to Tarzan ?
24	What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself ?
37	While these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation , it creates a certain amount of somberness that is not always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original .
21	One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane 's relationship .
20	Tarzan still speaks very broken English , but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate .
26	Additionally , their love for each other has really blossomed , and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle .
20	Most people consider " Tarzan and His Mate " superior to the original " Tarzan the Ape Man " .
13	Personally , I liked the first film just a little bit better .
36	The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt & Martin Arlington team is not nearly as likable as Holt 's relationship with James Parker ( Jane 's father ) from the original .
26	The Mr. Arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain , but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie .
30	Like the first film , " Tarzan and His Mate " has amazing action scenes , wonderful wildlife footage , and one of the screen 's all-time greatest romances .
18	If you liked the first film in the series , this is definitely a sequel to see .
14	When I was a kid it was Lex Barker 's time as Tarzan .
43	I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller " was " Tarzan and I would not understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller 's last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape .
22	It was not after many years that I came across " Tarzan and His Mate " , and then I understood .
42	Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other Tarzans such as Barker , Gordon Scott , Jock Mahoney , Denny Miller , Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert .
33	O'Sullivan character 's sparkling personality steals the show out of Tarzan himself , except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily ; the combination is perfect .
7	Good for Jane and her mate !
13	Like Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ) , only more so .
38	There is more of everything , more animals , more varied African tribes , and scenes in which the thought must be , if this was good with three or four lions , forty would be better .
25	Tarzan wrestles with crocodiles  the the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin , around and around , jaws flapping .
16	Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still .
13	Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals .
15	His friends are real chimps , people wearing larger ape costumes , and elephants .
25	In fact , they use Indian elephants  far more friendly and trainable than African ones  with costume ears attached to their heads .
29	The human story : another white man , worse than the rest , shows up to join with Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard .
24	Tarzan will not show them the way , so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed .
23	Tarzan intercedes , and the bad guy shoots him  but , of course , he survives and returns to save Jane .
17	This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes .
28	There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude , and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing .
21	Apparently one of Weismuller 's friends from the Olympic swim team did the nude scenes , and not Maureen O'Sullivan .
32	She , however , moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears ( plus a bikini top ) , showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip .
10	They still do not need to talk a lot .
15	They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities .
6	No wonder they are happy .
21	I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her .
22	The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen .
23	After the original film , we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other .
31	Jane 's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan 's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically , but also quite sexually in love .
32	One 's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally , romantically and sexually .
17	And Jane 's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality .
11	The skin show in this film is off the charts .
34	The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips .
21	It 's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry .
25	Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come , they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .
14	As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies .
29	Unlike others however , I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like .
18	Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle .
20	In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made .
15	This occurs when Harry 's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals .
23	The pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism , genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle .
25	The film also offers , though perhaps antecedently , an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers .
16	In addition sexy Jane , thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas !
8	Not to be missed an adventure classic .
37	Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films , I have no argument with that , although there are a couple of others I thought just as entertaining .
18	One thing : it 's the longest of the series that I have seen at 105 minutes .
33	I have only seen six of them but this was longer than I am used to and with the drawn-out action finale I thought the whole thing was a bit too long .
14	Nonetheless , it is a good mixture of action , suspense and romance .
10	The only things missing are color and stereo sound .
20	The primitive special-effects do not bother me , as that was all that they had back in the 1930s .
42	Among some , this film is most noted for one thing : skin ! " Jane " never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the Hays ' Code was instituted by the time the next Tarzan film was made .
11	Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed .
15	The nude underwater scene , however , was not her - by a longshot .
18	The woman under the water did not have a good figure at all , whoever it was .
8	There is plenty of action in here .
12	Up to the finale , it was not overdone , either .
23	The ending went on for 15 minutes , though , and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch .
39	Still , this movie offers about everything - except " Boy " ( their adopted son ) - you 'd want to see in a Tarzan film , even O'Sullivan doing her Tarzan yell about a dozen times .
13	With her pair of " lungs , " that was no problem .
35	There is something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it , including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke .
34	Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes , which are admittedly dull , Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot , offering non-stop action , humor , and romance .
15	Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie .
6	Weismuller is solid as well .
3	Highly recommended .
15	The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN , in 1932 , caused a sensation .
49	It may be hard to believe , 70 years later , but the film had much of the same kind of impact as THE MATRIX , or THE LORD OF THE RINGS has achieved , at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment .
26	Tarzan became an instant pop icon , the ' noble savage ' that every woman fantasized about , and every man wished he could be .
34	MGM , realizing the value of it 's newest ' star ' , knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original ... and TARZAN AND HIS MATE delivered !
34	The film incorporated the best elements of the original ( safaris , murderous tribes , Tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save Jane ) , and actually improved on the storytelling .
47	Harry Holt ( Neil Hamilton ) , from the first film , returns to Africa for ivory from the ' Elephants ' Graveyard ' , and to try to seduce Jane into returning to England , with gifts of silk dresses , underwear , and perfume .
27	Tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with Jane , and puts his foot down , refusing to allow the hunters into the Graveyard .
28	Arlington finds his opportunity , catching the Ape Man alone , and shoots him , then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise .
34	Now Jane has no reason to remain in the jungle , and she can direct them to the Graveyard , before her long voyage back to England , comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic Arlington .
33	But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group ... can Tarzan , being nursed back to health by his ape ' family ' , recover in time to save Jane ?
28	Johnny Weissmuller was in peak condition , physically , Maureen O'Sullivan was never more beautiful , and ' Africa ' never looked more romantic , and dangerous .
31	TARZAN AND HIS MATE was a triumph ( although it would be drastically edited for many years ) , and remains THE classic of the series , to this day !
25	With Iphigenia , Mikhali Cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen .
30	His own screenplay , an adaptation of Euripides ' tragedy , was far from easy , compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed .
31	The story has been very carefully deconstructed from Euripides ' version and placed in a logical , strictly chronological framework , better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling .
25	Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in Euripides ' tragedy : Odysseus , Calchas , and the army .
22	This was done in order to make some of Euripides ' points regarding war , the Church , and Government clearer .
15	Finally , Cacoyannis ' Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides ' .
9	The film was shot on location at Aulis .
28	The director of photography , Giorgos Arvanitis , shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece , where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still .
21	He takes advantage of the bodies , the arid land , the ruins , the intense light and the darkness .
15	The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters .
49	The camera uses the whole gamut of available shots , from the very long , reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape , as well as the human scale involved , to the extreme close-ups , dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters .
31	No word but " sublime " can describe the stunning performances of Costa Kazakos ( Agamemnon ) , Irene Papas ( Clytemnestra ) , and Tatiana Papamoschou ( Iphigenia ) .
12	Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy .
28	Kazakos ' character is extremely down-to-earth , and his powerful look into the camera , more than his words , reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul .
11	Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays .
23	In Iphigenia , she is terrible in her anguish , and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance .
34	Tatiana Papamoskou , in her first role on the screen , is outstanding in her portray of the innocent Iphigenia , which contrasts with Kazakos ' austere depiction of her father , Agamemnon .
11	The costumes and sets are realistic : no Hollywood there .
23	Agamemnon 's quarters resembles a barn , he dresses , as do the others , in utilitarian , hand-woven , simple garb .
12	Clytemnestra 's royal caravan is made up of rough-hewn wooden carts .
12	The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis .
26	Theodorakis ' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding , reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy , and accentuates its dimensions and actuality .
30	This film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient Greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization .
15	It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures .
33	Euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love , and reflects on woman 's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence .
24	In his adaptation of Euripides ' tragedy , Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern , clear , and dramatic fashion .
34	The relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated : war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer .
16	And so in a real sense , Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War .
34	The war , stripped of all Homeric glamor and religious sanctioning , was just an imperialist venture , spurred primarily by the desire for material gain , all else being a convenient pretext .
15	Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State .
35	Calchas , who represents the Church , feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves , tells him to sacrifice his daughter .
36	In consenting to the sacrifice , the King comes closer to his moral undoing , but in refusing , loses his power over the masses ( his army ) , who are brainwashed by religion .
11	Of course , for Agamemnon , it 's a game .
36	The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not , until he realizes , too late , that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide .
19	Is it a sacrifice or a murder , and how can we tell the difference between the two ?
43	By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice -- and , worst of all , the sacrifice of one 's own child -- Euripides / Cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal .
29	It touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society : the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society .
33	In the case of Iphigenia , however , as in the Biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac , the father is asked to kill his own child , by his own hand .
10	What sort of God would insist on such payment ?
12	Can it be just or moral , even if divinely inspired ?
25	Finally , does the daughter 's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war ?
11	These are many deep questions raised by a two-hour film .
9	Has anyone been able to buy this movie ?
38	My Uncle " Hutch " was a Real ( not Reel ) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot 's wings .
18	He 's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie .
17	He was killed in a dogfight over Italy , he was only 24 at the time .
10	Do we know the film studio that made it ?
13	Or has anyone seen it at a video store , like Blockbuster ?
24	I wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVD 's these days .
15	Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy .
3	Thank you .
19	I saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with it .
31	It took 30 + years , but I recently did find it on DVD - it was not cheap , either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies .
10	We watched it last night for the first time .
16	The audio was good , however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels .
11	Even so , it was better than I remembered it .
13	I was also impressed at how true it was to the play .
7	The catalog is around here someplace .
25	If you are sincere in finding it , fire me a missive and I will see if I can get you the info . cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
39	William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart 's hit Broadway play with music / recruiting poster-vivant , but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman : George Cukor .
38	The " women 's director " has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training , and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed , particularly in wartime .
36	Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday , who does not show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse .
33	It 's disingenuous and corny in spots , but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly , and it deserves to be more widely seen .
6	This movie gets it right .
17	As a former USAF Aviation Cadet , I can tell you this movie has it all .
7	The tedium of the application process .
5	The waiting for word .
5	The joy of acceptance .
9	The worry about making it through the course .
17	The sorrow of watching one 's buddies ( perhaps the best of them ) wash out .
15	The anguish of paying the ultimate price - the death of fllow student airmen .
5	The glory of graduation .
10	Always the flying , the flying , the flying .
8	Many are called but few are chosen .
13	We did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do .
37	This movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a Los Angeles television station 's " late show " .
47	I did not see the movie again for over 30 years , when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a " bootlegged " copy on VHS ( poor video quality , but good audio ) .
18	My memory of it was correct : it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch .
40	The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are terrific , especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant ( for those times ) 4-engine bomber ( then 18,000 + manufactured , now nearly extinct ) can be seen .
16	I hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy .
9	I had a personal interest in this movie .
29	When I was 17 and just out of high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Laborers and Hod Carriers Union .
37	At the end of my first day ( sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier ) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc . for one or two weeks .
21	When I arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego .
18	Just short of there we stopped at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn .
20	Once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into Camp Pendleton , the big Marine base .
20	There , on the beach , we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base .
29	It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation , which included a water tank , gun entrenchments , sand-bagged trenches and living quarters .
22	All this was at very high pay , sometimes ' golden time ' , which was triple our regular hourly wage .
32	Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch , etc . - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home .
24	Once the job was finished I waited eagerly for the movie to come out , which was about eight or ten months later .
18	Then I waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen .
29	Then it was no more than three or four minutes ( maybe less ) of the movie 's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens .
8	A bit disappointing , but still fun .
16	In spite of the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since .
33	I learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost plus basis , which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there .
2	Bob Weverka
17	This movie is a ripoff of James Cain 's novel , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE .
40	Apparently , the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story -- perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties !
17	Despite this , the movie is not really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie .
18	In some ways it 's a lot better and in other ways , it is definitely not .
13	The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people .
13	In fact , the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking .
33	The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair ( particularly on the back and shoulders ) and his lady love is , to put it frankly , unattractive .
19	They are a very , very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version .
45	And the ill-fated husband is really , really obese and loves to walk around shirtless -- and his counterpart in the American film , Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking ( and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads , actually ) .
23	Whereas , the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable .
16	Part of the Italian film 's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex .
25	The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway , they never actually get around to sex !
8	This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic .
45	In addition to the casual sexuality of the film , it 's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life -- with lots of sweaty people , a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath .
13	The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film .
12	And what you get due to brevity is not all good .
25	The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film -- with grainier footage , relatively poor orchestration and sets .
19	It sure ai not a pretty film , but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic .
13	But it can not make up for the short-cuts in the plot .
18	Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over .
40	And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film -- and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats ( the best part of the American film ) .
7	So which is the better film ?
11	Well , a lot of this probably depends on you .
37	As for me , the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic ( though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles ) -- but it packed a great ending .
20	And the Italian film was much , much more realistic -- until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed .
22	So neither film is exactly great , but I 'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better .
20	It 's too bad they could not have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .
20	The Ruth Snyder - Judd Gray murder in 1927 inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway play called Machinal .
41	More famously , it inspired James M. Cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with - Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice .
21	Both became film noir classics of the 1940 's , Double Indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made .
48	Some of the real-life elements of the Snyder-Gray story were captured by Cain - the old age and indifference of Albert Gray , Ruth 's high sex drive , Ruth and Judd 's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause .
23	Missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban Manhattan - Albert Snyder being a respected newspaper editor .
17	The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase .
28	Cain 's Double Indemnity was filmed perfectly by Billy Wilder - let us ignore Stanwyck 's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore !
31	The Postman Always Rings Twice , however , was filmed thrice and Ossessione , an Italian version and Luchino Visconti 's first film , was the first of three versions .
42	Before commenting on it , I will recommend the Lana Turner - John Garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 Jack Nicholson - Jessica Lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table .
12	Ossessione is not as noirish as The Postman Always Rings Twice .
24	It has a strong neo-realist look which makes it a great movie , but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing .
11	It does not have low-key lighting and unconventional camera angles .
14	The dialog is not hard-boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization .
14	This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization .
12	Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version .
15	We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac .
18	A new character is introduced into the story - La Spagnola - with very obvious homosexual overtones .
19	There is also a small , but very well-played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute .
14	This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime .
11	The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime .
23	The drifter is a complete tramp , the wife is no Lana Turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage .
13	Her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese , rude and arrogant .
10	I think the casting was brilliant for this film .
10	My only beef is with the overlong running time .
20	Everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical .
16	Nevertheless , fans of noir and realism will definitely like Ossessione , as I did .
24	In the sixties and seventies , Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released .
46	They have not done that here , but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film ' The Postman Always Rings Twice ' , without giving the book 's author , James M. Cain , so much as a credit !
29	Anyway , the plot focuses on Gino Costa , a handsome drifter who , by chance , stumbles upon a café where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works .
27	He soon learns that she 's married to Giuseppe ; a big fat annoying man , whom Giovanna can not stand to have even touching her .
21	He wants the pair of them to run away together , but she 's not so keen on the idea .
24	The story is , as you would expect , extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast .
38	Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much , however , and with a running time of almost 135 minutes , I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length .
28	I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film , but it 's not a ' great ' film .
36	The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly , and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters ' heads .
41	There is not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what 's going on , and by not always focusing on the characters themselves ; the film is not as interesting as it could have been .
33	Still , it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason ... although it 's not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic .
48	Ossessione Luchino Visconti 's debut film , this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement -- well , it says so right on the back of the box -- and is a sometimes penetrating , sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux .
41	Set in Fascist Italy , an assortment of supporting characters -- including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues -- embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without , drifting phantasms longing for a soul .
21	All the same , it 's incisive and essential , although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable .
11	' Iphigenia ' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis .
18	This masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast .
5	Cacoyannis achieved the impossible .
16	He managed to film a Greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance .
9	A stellar greek cast helps him in this .
9	Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia .
21	Equally impressive is Irene Papas , who even though she sometimes seems over the top , it is very realistic .
28	A wonderful Greek film , beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis , with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis which is ideal in every scene .
20	P.S. Rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film Oscar by only 1 vote ! ! !
25	Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out .
20	The structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy Hollywood conventions  as well as other major theatrical elements .
14	It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light .
22	Films of this nature  the neo-realist films  were made to reflect the darkness felt during post-World War II times .
29	Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war , including : adultery , conspiracy , murder , pregnancy , etc .
33	Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments , the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty : shot on-location , uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors .
29	All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film , yielding the following theme : Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally .
28	The two leads  Gino and Giovanna  are polar opposites , yet both carry the mentality : we are bored and we want to be entertained .
16	Gino is a drifter ; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations .
36	Giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence : she does not want to leave her home and husband , but would rather remain where she is because it 's safer .
48	Gino 's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves ; the only difference is that she 's too afraid to live it herself  that 's why she falls in love with Gino : he represents everything she wants but does not have the courage to get .
27	She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husband  Gino is the perfect ticket into that world .
20	The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40 's feeling somewhat uneasy .
18	I mean , films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before .
11	To say the least it was probably a bit alarming .
18	In conjunction with the theme , the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior .
20	Succinctly put , adulterous behavior ( as shown in the film ) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives .
30	When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to " eliminate " Giovanna 's husband , karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done .
23	They return to their home : the atmosphere is dark and biting ( as can be expected from the neo-realist style ) .
11	They are not happy ; they are actually more depressed .
20	They thought that by eliminating Giovanna 's husband that they 'd live happier lives , but they were duped .
19	The film ends with Giovanna 's death  it being in karmic similitude of her husband 's death .
12	I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons .
4	Here 's why .
26	There is a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen , and if so , to what extent .
29	I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified , but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have .
13	As the subtext of Ossessione asks , is adultery and murder evil ?
8	I think the film eagerly responds yes !
12	The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are .
33	I think it was the author 's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior , in the end karma will come back to haunt them .
3	I agree .
30	I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfish  always wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times .
44	This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship : he can not handle the pressure of living in Giovanna 's husband shadow , so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl .
10	Such is typical of the insatiable , hedonistic personality .
13	All in all , the film seemed very risky for its time .
20	The audience , however , was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought .
11	Those pre-war , happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed .
39	Movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters : they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called ' sin ' because it was a reflection of their own life problems .
18	Ossessione , then , acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading .
25	That is , a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement .
6	Oh , those sneaky Italians .
30	It 's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the , in this case , author of the novel .
38	Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema , mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it .
30	James M. Cain 's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic .
21	The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it 's a great movie nevertheless .
34	This of course not in the least is due to the movie it 's great strong story , that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism .
35	It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story , with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment .
19	Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it .
21	These early drama 's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch .
26	Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end , when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts .
10	The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier .
16	Nevertheless , I do not really have much else negative to say about this movie .
18	It 's simply a greatly made one , based on some equally great and strong source material .
24	Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti , who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies . 8/10
40	Visconti 's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique , accompanied by compelling performances from Massimo Girotti as the handsome drifter and , best of all , Clara Calamai as the fabulous , frantic Giovanna .
14	Remade several times as ' The Postman Rings Twice ' but never bettered .
11	Can not believe this was the man 's first film !
13	It shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career .
46	I am not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain 's novel " The Postman Always Rings Twice " ( I am not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book 's rights ) , but the resulting movie is definitely interesting .
50	It is not the best version of Cain 's story ( I like the 1981 version best ) , but thanks to Visconti 's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti ( a very sensual couple ) , it is a must for noir fans .
10	Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect .
8	The film is not perfect , though .
40	My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good ; the story moves at a very slow pace ( I do not think Visconti was very good at editing his films ) .
12	I think film noir works better with a short running time .
14	Fortunately , Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested .
28	Anyhow , as much as I like this film and the remakes , I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain 's much-praised book .
36	When people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama , they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it 's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic , melancholic roles .
21	This opinion , however , does not resemble Neorealist movies , in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti .
26	OSSESSIONE as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others .
37	The contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself , exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past .
44	At the same time , while being based on the novel by James M. Cain , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE , it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style , view , his own art .
26	I have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which I 'd like to entail below .
26	First , Visconti 's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life , in particular those absorbed by desire .
17	These people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face .
28	Gino ( Massimo Girotti ) a traveler with " bear like shoulders " turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near Ferrara and enters the tavern .
49	Her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love , the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together ... However , are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire ?
7	Can one build love upon murder ?
8	What is love and what is loyalty ?
11	Does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession ?
20	Therefore , the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart .
8	Yet , it constantly remains thought provoking .
31	Second , OSSESSIONE has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers : brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography , which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power .
20	These make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch .
11	They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots .
36	Who can possibly skip that moment in Ferrara where Gino meets a beautiful girl , a sort of " Ragazza Perfetta " ( perfect girl ) , a dancer Anita and buys her ice cream .
17	His desires show him totally different direction ... Do viewers remain indifferent at Gino-Giovanna's first meeting ?
20	The first focus of camera is on Giovanna 's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that Gino experiences .
27	A marvel of shot is Gino and Giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look .
19	Third , OSSESSIONE can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast .
37	Massimo Girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done ; yet , consequently , what comes out is a flawless acting .
31	He portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but can not stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim , which represents conscience .
27	His bisexuality is indicated through the character of Lo Spagnolo ( Elio Marcuzzo ) whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for Ancona .
36	Clara Calamai , who was cast in the role after eminent Anna Magnani had refused , fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple .
6	They are both very convincing .
30	Besides , I liked Juan De Langa in the role of Bragana : he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art .
33	In some of his most witty moments , he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance .
24	In sum , we , as modern viewers who are capable of critical view , have to look at this film very objectively .
31	It is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned , it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries ; yet , is it educational ?
16	Visconti was not Fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity .
25	In such case , his films would only entertain ( which is , of course , not entirely Fellini 's style , too ) .
7	Visconti always had something to convey .
8	What did he want to say here ?
7	Is the film against bad marriage ?
12	Or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire ?
8	The final shocking moments say for themselves .
25	Though you do not have to agree with the vision , OSSESSIONE is really a wonderfully realistic film , one of Visconti 's best 8/10
32	A deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe : An impoverished Giovanna has ended up in the gutter , but still has an ace up her sleeve : beauty and youth .
34	Bragana , a fat-bellied gas station tenant , who has been getting on in years , picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection .
38	But the physical contact that Giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust , and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of .
17	The arrival of Gino , a young migrant worker , finally provides her the longed-for opportunity .
39	And you do not have to ask her twice : At the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired , and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance .
16	The developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by Giovanna though .
30	Gino 's yearning for freedom is suppressed , his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside .
26	Giovanna aims at another goal : to get Bragana killed , to inherit and , in addition to that , to collect the insurance premium .
10	In her hands Gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool .
15	Being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold-blooded killer .
15	But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level .
28	The very taking over of Bragana 's place , which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man , causes a deep loathing of himself .
46	And later , after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through Giovanna 's cunningly devised plan , he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute .
34	If Visconti 's film ended at this point , it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool , calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism .
14	But then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse .
29	At last Giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done , and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew Gino 's love .
23	Her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate .
23	It also affects us , while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster .
22	The culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start .
34	To get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track , not only the music , but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery .
18	How beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity !
16	Note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside Giovanna 's marriage .
16	Do not expect to find much here of the political life of Italy in 1943 .
8	That 's not what this is about .
29	On the other hand , if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds , you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism .
29	By the end of the film we there are moments Antonioni-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places .
9	This is one of my favorite Visconti films .
31	His look was ahead of its time ... many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a major world wide star ! !
30	A masterful treatment of James Caine 's " The Postman Always Rings Twice " as Luchino Visconti 's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war-torn Italy .
22	The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today .
35	I did not know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material , after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit .
37	Neo-realism , by the way , could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather ( along with De Sica 's The Children Are Watching Us ) , which that would take shape after the war .
48	Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts , it 's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion , and it 's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism ( the lower-class , death , desperation ) .
36	I think I have just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along , even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads .
32	The two leads ( Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai ) portray all the compelling , truthful , and near-operatic emotions , and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes .
26	It 's a brilliant , crushing adaptation , and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career .
17	I have not seen this movie in about 5 years , but it still haunts me .
19	When asked about my favorite films , this is the one that I seem to always mention first .
13	It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days .
20	Ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen .
23	The material used is a " Master positive " 2nd generation originally from the print Visconti managed to hide from the fascists .
22	It has been scanned on the Spirit 4K ( as 2K RGB data ) then processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software .
17	After this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring .
17	Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD .
19	This film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come .
19	Gino Costa ( Massimo Girotti ) is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar .
34	He meets the young , beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana ( Clara Calamai ) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana ( Juan de Landa ) , owners of the bar .
18	He trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging , and has an affair with Giovanna .
12	They both decide to kill Giuseppe , forging a car accident .
18	The relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police .
8	This masterpiece ends in a tragic way .
11	The noir and neo-realistic movie of Luchino Visconti is outstanding .
19	This is the first time that I watch this version of ` The Postman Always Rings Twice ' .
42	I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner , and the 1981 version , where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema , but this one is certainly the best .
5	My vote is ten .
2	Wow !
16	The sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances .
3	Absolutely incredible !
25	If this was Visconti 's debut film , i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film .
34	The only other one of his i have seen ( at time of writing ) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible : more dazzling visually than Ossessione ( Obsession ) .
21	One of the most beautiful films i have ever seen , but its story was not as involving as Ossessione .
23	If you click on " miscellaneous " on this page 's links , there are stills from the movie on those websites .
21	Also , eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen , Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual !
10	The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema !
14	Yes , i am being superlative , but Ossessione was just that terrific .
28	The reason Ossessione did not cause the impact Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini , and re-cut in America .
16	American audiences did not see its full glory till 59 , eight years AFTER Streetcar .
40	I will not say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best , most beautiful and exciting movies i have ever seen , and tell you to go out and see it !
18	Like another reviewer , i am going to buy it as soon as i can find it !
10	Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries .
44	The great directors of Italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium , but it was Luchino Visconti , a man of vision , who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing .
27	Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia , a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings .
14	The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently .
38	The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti 's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way , something the American version lacked .
19	What comes across watching the movie , is the intensity which the director got from his key players .
48	The magnificent Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna , the woman who has married an older man , but when Gino appears in her life , all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life .
17	Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms. Calamai 's achievements in the Italian cinema .
30	The last sequence of the film shows Ms. Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed .
30	Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti , one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino , the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna .
25	Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna , something that Mr. Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen .
27	Mr. Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy , yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent .
17	Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe , the older man who fell in love with Giovanna .
24	In fact , his character rings truer than his counterpart in the American film , where he is seen more as a buffoon .
12	The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti .
18	They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way Italian directors of the era favored .
10	The original musical score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect .
31	Even better is this gem from Italy , which , I have read , was ` mutilated ' in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime .
25	Well , no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema , apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making .
43	One can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on , a pervading sense of societal and cultural , as well as personal oppression remains , hanging heavy over the protagonists , who therefore face many limits in life .
42	Consider Gino , the young drifter , not well educated , unemployed , and resorting to stowing away , stealing and conning people in order to get by , his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless .
40	In the past , she had limited options , and decided to marry the restaurant / gas station owner ( Giuseppe Bregana , played by Juan de Landa ) anyway , knowing that he would not make her happy .
13	She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her .
13	They immediately start a heated , passionate , yet volatile love affair .
26	Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship , and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband .
35	Wanting no part of it , Gino leaves town on a train ride that he can not afford , kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo , a fellow train passenger .
34	To Gino , Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom , and they become friends ( Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino 's morality and conscience ) , traveling and finding work at a carnival together .
6	Finally Gino has steady employment .
24	Too weak-willed to resist , knowing this will reunite he and Giovanna , Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple .
17	After a while he gives in to Gina 's demands to get rid of her husband .
40	Once the evil deed is done , Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever , seeming to have very little conscience , while guilt and shame eat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm .
26	As much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly , they are now inextricably linked , and must face the consequences .
37	I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino 's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good , and interesting , adding another dimension to the story .
49	While the ' 46 U.S. version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters , especially the cops and the lawyers , Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone .
28	This gives the final outcome even more potency , and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live .
20	I found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere .
9	Otherwise , well worth the viewer 's time .
10	The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout .
2	Recommended .
20	Visconti 's first feature , Ossessione is an adaptation of James M. Cain 's The Postman Always Rings Twice .
48	Now , I am not familiar with that book or the other film versions , but I am a big fan of Cain 's Double Indemnity ( much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder 's film version of it , in fact ) .
11	The two novellas seem like they must be very similar .
26	Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her .
33	Giovanna , the woman in this Italian version , played very well by Clara Calamai , is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity , but she seems very spoiled .
32	Her husband ( a great performance by Juan de Landa ) is a bit cruel to her , but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him .
14	He 's older than her and unattractive , so she 's rather fickle .
23	When Gino shows up , a young , muscular man , it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed .
18	She sweats she wants to be with him forever , but she 's stuck with her husband .
28	They break up at first , but when they meet again , they ( apparently , although this is intentionally vague ) plan to murder the husband .
23	They are successful , and they move back to the woman 's home town to run the bar that her husband owned .
8	Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea .
28	He wants Giovanna , but the one thing that he certainly does not want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life .
5	Their relationship quickly crumbles .
10	Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters .
15	It 's always fascinating , but it does go on a bit too long .
25	At two hours and twenty-two minutes , I can not , for the life of me , figure out how it took that long !
16	This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film .
14	It was , after all , the first film that won that label .
25	We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life , without any hurrying to the next plot point .
28	I have seen many of Visconti 's films , and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers ( 1960 ) .
20	His direction is as great as it ever was , with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect .
43	I also feel the need to point out the film 's best performance , by Dhia Christiani as a young ( exotic ) dancer and part-time prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after he begins to try to break away from Giovanna .
21	She 's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes , and she has only a few lines .
21	It 's shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time .
7	She 's absolutely heartbreaking . 9/10 .
7	This is a really fun movie .
23	One of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted ; more and more funny .
23	Sally Field , Teri Hatcher ( in her hey-day ) , Kevin Klein , Elisabeth Shue , Robert Downey , Jr. . .
19	It 's all these well-known , quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars / producers .
32	If you have ever watched a soap opera and thought , " How on earth did they come up with THIS idea ? ? " , you will LOVE this movie .
32	I have seen it multiple times ; and each time I watch it , the more I appreciate the humor , the more I realize just how well-acted it really is .
6	Do not expect Oscar quality .
23	This is a fun movie to entertain , not some artsy attempt at finding " man 's inner man " , etc .
8	Sit back , relax , and laugh .
26	This is a haunting , powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain 's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice directed by the great Luchino Visconti .
45	What is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it 's source material to become something bolder and more original ( interestingly Camus also credits Cain 's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger ) .
34	The film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of Cain 's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender .
27	This allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate , doomed love affair of the two main characters .
11	This film is a complex , suspenseful , rewarding experience .
32	Visconti makes an amazing directing début , taking the ( uncredited ) plot of " The Postman Always Rings Twice " as a guide to the development of his own themes .
15	It strikes us even today how ahead of its time " Ossessione " was .
21	All the copies of " Ossessione " were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral .
44	Visconti managed to save a print , and when the film was re-released after the war , most critics called it the front-runner of the Neo-Realist movement , preceding Rossellini 's " Roma CIttà Aperta " and De Sica 's " Sciuscià " .
48	While " Ossessione " may be Neo-Realistic in its visual language ( the depiction of war-time paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs , poverty , child labor , prostitution , bums , swindlers etc ) , the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian .
48	He was always more interested in tragic , passionate , obsessive , greedy characters , in social / political / sexual apartheid , in the decadence of the elites than in realistic , " everyday - life " characters and themes , favored by DeSica and Rossellini .
17	Well when watching this film late one night I was simple amazed by it 's greatness .
19	Fantastic script , great acting , costumes and special effects , and the plot twists , wow ! !
16	In fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself .
20	Great , I would recommend this film to anyone , especially if I don ; t like them much .
1	Terrific
10	Its Hollywood imitating Daytiem Soap Operas at its finest !
8	Its the fun that we never see .
6	Great characters and great lines .
28	Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so over the top .... Gary Marshalls lines are a riot .... this is what I love about good comedies .
13	Never afraid to poke fun at themselves ! ! ! ! ! !
21	The sets were great .... wardrobe was on point and the backstabbing " Montana Morehead " was a devilish delight .
25	Terri Hatcher as " Dr. Monica Demonico " did not have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen .
14	I would love to know how the idea for this movie came up .
17	Never have I seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work !
15	Soapdish is a must have and I am waiting for the DVD ! ! !
28	When I started watching the show I said " Oh , no ! It 's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody ! " .
40	And indeed , the setup is almost identical , with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself , then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him .
8	But this is where the resemblance stops .
25	The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha , while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few .
47	The magical setup is a bit corny , because it 's about seven people , with seven servants , fighting for the Holy Grail , all servants being someone famous , half of all masters being from the same school , rules of engagement , etc .
18	However , this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script .
37	I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and , without comparing it with animes that I liked more , but were from other genres , I have to say that I was very pleased .
7	This anime seriously rocked my socks .
31	When the anime first opened itself , I felt it was too slow ; the story was not quite moving forward , and Shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead .
35	Once he learns more about tracing , and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself , the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together .
4	It was fantastic .
27	Additionally , I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop , in the real world .
45	There was not any stupid completely obvious things going on ; the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch , but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on .
7	Anddd , I loved the music .
27	The opening music rocked , and the finishing theme from the final episode just ... Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more .
5	Good job , Type-MOON !
13	Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h-game .
17	Somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff .
47	It could not have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it 's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection . ( You will understand once you see all the episodes ) .
36	Despite a relatively slow start ( the producer took his time on presenting the characters ) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat .
27	The topic of the series concentrates on the War of Holy Grail that has been taking place in the Fukuky City for the last 50 years .
17	The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on .
23	Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city .
30	He unwillingly witnesses a fight between two Servants that triggers his Reiju ( Holy mark ) to summon one of the most powerful Servants of the battlefield , Saber .
22	His first contact with Saber left him stunned " Such immeasurable beauty ... I was at a lost for words " .
16	You must not compare this series with any other to fully understand it 's plot .
27	FSN offers much more than some cool sword fights , good animation , spectacular lights , great soundtrack , it offers excellent character and relationship development .
16	It presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate .
42	The action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals ( not similar to the linear type other series use ) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal , from under the mask of perfection , flawed characters .
24	The Saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such .
40	You should not watch FSN thinking that it does not present the viewer with the historic fact , just remember that this is adventure / fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can .
24	The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have watched them in the same breath .
11	I have to agree with everyone else that has posted .
32	I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they did not explain things properly but it did not ruin any part of the viewing experience .
40	I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research ( and watch the ending a few more times ) and I found all my answers and a whole lot more .
29	I 'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story , well built characters ( some mysterious ) and a bit of fantasy action .
44	Also , even though this was based on a H-game it does not have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way . ( I have no problem with mature anime , in most cases I prefer it )
32	When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV , I have to say that out of all the shows that I have seen , this one tops it all off .
15	I had to see this show , and that is what I really did .
15	When I got the first volume of this show , it was the best .
14	I really liked the animation , and all the fight scenes were awesome .
24	I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber , and Archer and of course I also like Illya .
17	And of course , all the episodes on the volumes were interesting , and very cool .
26	Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie ( famous for Transformers , and others ) playing the voice of Berserker .
7	He does have a cool character .
16	And I even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume .
18	So if you to see something good , then see this show , it 's the best .
14	I have watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing !
15	I have not been this interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion .
42	This series is actually based off an h-game , which I am not sure if it 's been done before or not , I have not played the game , but from what I have heard it follows it very well .
7	I give this series a 10/10 .
19	It has a great story , interesting characters , and some of the best animation I have seen .
11	It also has some great Japanese music in it too !
13	If you have not seen this series yet , check it out .
19	You can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there , it 's straight out of Japan .
8	Things to look for are : 1 .
10	The drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 .
12	The bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 .
7	The Flinstone-like screech out driving 4 .
32	The clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed ( do not worry , i am not ruining any surprises , for it 's soooo predictable ) 5 .
11	The guy who finds it necessary to howl . 6 .
22	The mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen . 7 .
5	This movie is great .
10	If you enjoy watching B-class movies , that is .
21	This is a classic college 80 's slasher movie , in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack .
25	A horrible film , but worth renting to make fun of , or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives .
8	Kinda funny , if you ask me .
28	The combination of the superb black and white photography and the ' Eugene Onegin with a twist ' plot made this a real knock out for me .
19	The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping .
43	There was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by Lensky 's heart-wrenching aria from the Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin .
49	For me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium , which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - Last Year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film .
7	Krisana is in the same mould .
9	This is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession .
25	Matiss , on a lonely night stroll in Riga ( ? ) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing .
7	He passes by without a word .
17	Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act .
9	And then only too little and too late .
13	The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman .
12	On a troll of local bars , he finds her pocketbook .
10	He pieces more and more of her life together .
10	His " look " changes as his obsession grows .
7	He has to make things right .
24	In a marvelously filmed dialog with the " bastard ex-boyfriend " he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel .
15	Haunting long takes , a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt , barking dogs .
2	Footsteps .
8	Lovely film noir with a lovely twist .
5	A good Indie ending .
21	This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife , daughter , and I found it irresistible .
24	The plot is just crazy but " rings true " to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities .
12	I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline 's and Sally Field 's performances .
11	I do not anyone better than Kline at playing THICKheaded .
42	Field 's character 's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of Field 's famous ( infamous ? ) " You like me ! " Oscar exclamation .
20	People who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world .
33	I think this is the only movie where I did not find myself impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization ; I thought she was " spot on " in every note she struck .
19	Robert Downey Jr. , Teri Hatcher , Cathy Moriarty , and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate as well .
19	Just a great movie if you are in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH !
32	That 's the plot in a nutshell , but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act .
30	As a detective who investigates the incident tells him , we usually do not bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die .
27	The only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the " college film class " look and sound of the film .
40	He or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist Latvian film most likely faces , but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of Matiss .
29	The background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a Fellini film , whether or not that was Kelemen 's intention .
39	The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money , but this constraint is used to the film 's advantage . " Krisana " succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious .
27	It could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story , but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt .
17	If you are more concerned with plot , this film and its ending may frustrate you .
11	Otherwise , take the time to be engaged by it .
6	It is well-worth seeking out .
20	A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between .
16	As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film .
14	Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL .
11	I am tired of the same old stuff in movies .

18	Just kidding about the weight loss thing ; well , you might lose weight you never know .
12	Anyway , what can I say , I love this film .
20	It has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies .
18	Jake 's Closet illustrates the beauty of life 's simple things and how often we overlook them .
28	The film reminds us what it 's like to see the world through children 's eyes and all the magic , mystery , and horror they perceive .
28	Jake 's Closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who 's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with .
18	Watch it with friends ; watch it with loved ones ; build a fort - wine optional .
29	I would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster .
17	I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family .
16	I found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions .
32	The scary monster although probably not scary to most adults , has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create .
8	I found the film to be delightful !
20	Jake 's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan 's Labyrinth .
15	Even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to Pan 's Labyrinth .
30	But this is a story that takes place in modern times , not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today .
25	Jake 's Closet is about a boy , an only child , practically alone on summer vacation , dealing with his family falling apart .
21	It 's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense , a horror movie for the thinking person .
42	If you are looking for a slasher movie , this will not be your cup of tea but if you are looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting , this is the movie for you .
18	At the screening I saw , I swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed .
7	I highly recommend catching this film .
35	Answer : despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman , your ex is creepier , nastier , and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth .
16	The acting in this independent film actually is quite good , despite the less-than-wonderful script .
20	It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten , clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable .
15	Young Anthony de Marco , as Jake , puts in a particularly good performance .
15	Fortunately , the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog .
12	Try it , especially if you are not a monster fan .
7	This is NOT a horror flick .
40	Even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous , and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film , " Jake 's Closet " is suitable for mature adults .
16	The whole , this time , is much better than the sum of its parts .
24	I 'd never seen an independent movie and I was really impressed by the writing , acting and cinematography of Jake 's Closet .
21	The emotions were very real and intense showing , through a child 's eyes , the harsh impact of divorce .
4	A definite see !

4	A definite see !
15	I saw this at " Dances with Films " , and it was awesome .
6	I really felt for Jake .
7	Talk about adding insult to injury !
16	Not only are your parents getting divorced , but there is a monster after you .
19	It was both heartfelt and scary -- there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright .
19	It kind of reminded me of a Japanese horror film , except that the story was actually good .
24	And that 's what separated " Jake 's Closet " from the usual indy film pabulum -- an excellent script with compelling characters .
30	Also , by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama , the movie gets the best out of both genres , and avoids the clichés of both .
14	If it 's not coming out in theaters , definitely get the DVD .
31	Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film 's protagonist , a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet .
23	Is Jake ( a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco ) simply " transferring " the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image ?
7	Or could the creature be real ?
15	Writer / director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing .
20	Her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia .
17	Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are highly convincing as the angry , but loving parents .
37	However it is the creepy minor characters , Mrs. Bender ( Barbara Gruen ) , an unhinged babysitter and Sam Stone ( Ben Bode ) , a sleazy Real estate agent that linger in the mind .
17	Jake 's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of Hell .
48	Every child experiences trauma growing up and every child 's active imagination has gotten the best of them , but for Jake ( Anthony De Marco  of the forthcoming Clint Eastwood film CHANGELING - who resembles Henry Thomas circa 1982 ) the combination may prove deadly .
32	Jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon ( Matthew Josten ) who provides him with a print out off the internet of FAQ re : zombies .
33	Jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it 's too late .
12	Here the film is very successful in getting its theme across .
32	The metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy-handed but again , the child 's fear of a thing under his bed is universal .
42	This may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time & through time to when one 's childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back & forth onwards & upwards , forwards & backwards , up & down & all around .
9	The boy Jimmy , H.R. Puffinstuff , Dr .
20	Blinky , Cling & Clang , Ludicrous Lion , & even the evil Witchie Poo too through & through .
11	Brady Bunch Hour & Even The Paul Lynde Halloween Special .
28	Maybe even other things in between & Beyond the Buck just keeps on moving on & on & even beyond expectations & as well as unexpected bounds .
34	Now as we get updated in March of ' 06 we know that Jack Wild 's gone & so now it make 's it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic .
7	The Brady Bunch Hour ; etc .
22	Truthfully , Stephen " Steve " G. Baer a . k . a . " Ste " of Framingham , Ma .

13	I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 .
9	It was on right after Bay City Rollers .
21	I saw it come on to Family Channel one day , and taped it for my then three-year old daughter .
25	I 'd forgotten all the things I 'd loved as a child , the magic flute , the zoom broom , Witcheepoo 's makeup .
7	This show is decidedly low tech .
21	The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese , and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes .
6	But kids love this stuff .
22	They would way , way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation .
25	There is ( mild ) slapstick , but no adult themes such as sex or people dying , and kids accept Jimmy 's schemes .
44	Kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire , and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead .
20	The music is old , but you really get used to it , and my daughter really loved it .
17	She used to sing " different is hard , different is lonely " in the car .
24	My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months , and it 's still one of her favourites .
12	I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works .
20	I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and do not do anything like computer-animating characters etc .
10	I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf .
17	I remember seeing this on TV in the late 70s - and it stayed with me !
13	It 's charming , loud , colourful - a great kids film .
23	If you like the banana splits and you are in your 30 's this will re-create that surreal childhood Saturday morning vibe !
25	Even if I have realised now that Puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away !
20	Quality TV movie - if , like me , you are into death metal - you will love it !
6	Pufnstuf is what it is .
22	I saw this in the cinema at age 4 and I have very fond , and vivid , memories of it .
22	It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time , and in some ways quite progressive .
35	The track Different , for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself , not running with the pack , and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different .
17	This could be an anthem to the gay community , it should be , great track .
43	Martha Raye , Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches , and the Living Island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits ( includes Billy Barty , Felix Silla and other famous names ) .
42	There is a LOT of over acting in this film - there is really nothing subtle , and when little Jack Wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island it 's really little more than yelling .
11	This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel .
14	While I think of it - I never could stand the flute though .
27	I love the soundtrack , especially the above mentioned Different but also Zap The World , Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild 's touching If I Could .
20	What 's more , it IS now out on CD from the tasteful people at El Records in London .
6	See here for more : www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
8	This is why I still have nightmares .
16	This terrifying film ( a musical ) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s .
11	A boy leaves on a magical journey to an island .
50	The mayor of the island , Pufnstuf , allegedly a dragon , looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me , and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch ( Billie Halliday , who was considered ' a bit of alright ' at the time ) .
21	The flute is recovered at an ' interesting ' witches convention , with the witches having a gay old time .
16	The boy dresses in drag then as a ' fairy ' to recover the flute .
5	Not suitable for children .
24	I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the dashingly talented Jack Wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of Jack Wild too .
13	This movie is exactly what movies should be : fun and entertaining .
9	This movie is not limited to children either .
34	A lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and Witchiepoo 's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully .
22	And as a Jack Wild fan , I would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing .
27	Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song " If I Could " .
25	It makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that I am now passing on to my children .
14	Let us all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun !
14	And keep Jack Wild 's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff on to others .
11	I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid .
8	I cried every time I watched it .
7	It was not weird to me .
7	I totally identified with the characters .
17	I would love to see it again ( and hope I wont be disappointed ! ) .
6	Pufnstuf rocks ! ! ! !
10	I was really drawn in to the fantasy world .
8	And to me the movie was loooong .
13	I wonder if I ever saw the series and have confused them ?
7	The acting I thought was strong .
5	I loved Jack Wilde .
26	This film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for TV , but it is one of the best movies I have seen .
9	The film and its actors won several awards .
13	It is gripping , fascinating , and it will absorb you completely .
46	The story of a chase for a killer in iron-curtain Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction -- but it 's ostensibly a true story .
5	I highly recommend it .
